</div>

<p>Some years ago a literary investigator came into my office and inquired
whether he could find a copy of Richard Tickell’s <i>Anticipation</i> in our
library. He was thinking of sending to the British Museum for a photostatic
copy, in case we could not supply his need. We were able to reply
that we had sixteen editions of this book—ten of them printed in the
year 1778 alone. Now publishers do not re-issue a book unless someone
is reading it. The number of reprints induced me to read the book, and
I found it one of the best of eighteenth-century satires on the ponderous
serio-comic addresses delivered in what is still pleased to call itself the
M-th-r of P-rl—m-nts. Though Mr. Butterfield has restrained himself
in the matter of drawing parallels between the bumbling follies of that
legislative conclave, then and now, yet the writer of a foreword may be
permitted to do so.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1941, I received in the mail a pamphlet, in an envelope
which bore a Chinese postage stamp and the postmark of Shanghai.
The pamphlet was one of the familiar blue-covered fascicles which we all
recognize as the format of the <i>Parliamentary Debates</i>. This particular
fascicle purported to contain the debate for August 15, 1941, and was
typographically exact, even to the reproduction of the arms of H-s
Br-t-nn-c M-j-sty on the cover. An examination revealed it to be the
twentieth-century parallel of Tickell’s <i>Anticipation</i>—a satiric report of
the debates in the H—s- of C-mm-ns as of 1941. It was obvious German
propaganda, but so well done typographically that I found some of my
learned colleagues had read a part of it before it dawned on them that
the whole thing was analogous to Tickell’s <i>Anticipation</i>. But let no American
be complacent about the failure of the H—s- of C-mm-ns to progress
during the intervening one hundred and sixty-three years. Let him dip
into our own <i>C-ngr-ss—n-l R-c-rd</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Butterfield and the publisher could have chosen no more appropriate
time than the present at which to issue the twentieth-century edition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
of this book. It ought to be read by all students of American history—elementary
and advanced.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EDITORS_FOREWORD">EDITOR’S FOREWORD</h2>

</div>

<p>This is the first reprint since 1822 of a politico-literary satire that
delighted a generation of readers during and after the American War
of Independence. It has seemed to the editor, and to others who encouraged
the project, that the neglect of <i>Anticipation</i> has been due less
to its want of interest than to the want of a properly edited reprint. The
mere presence in it of so many names with deleted letters has discouraged
later readers.<a id="FNanchor_0" href="#Footnote_0" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The present volume provides an account of the author
and of the setting and reception of <i>Anticipation</i>, an accurate text,
explanatory notes, and a bibliography of Tickell’s writings.</p>

<p><i>Anticipation</i> was written and printed hastily; and the spelling (especially
of proper names), the punctuation, and sometimes even the grammar
are erratic. But since it has proved impossible to distinguish the carelessness
of the printer from that of the author, I have followed the first
issue literally except when corrections were available in the following
later ones: “The Third Edition, Corrected,” which appeared within a
week of first publication; “The Tenth Edition, Corrected,” 1780, which
was the last published during Tickell’s life; and “A New Edition, Corrected,”
1794, a re-issue occasioned, probably, by Tickell’s death and set
from new type. Two or three flagrant errors (e.g., the name “Bonille”
for “Bouillé” at p. 59) and a few typographical absurdities (such as
quotation marks without mates) recur in all the London issues. These I
have corrected without warrant from any text.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span></p>

<p>It should be stated that in the Introduction I have usually not cited
sources for dates and other biographical details when the sources are
correctly given in W. Fraser Rae’s article on Tickell in <i>The Dictionary
of National Biography</i>. Unless otherwise indicated, the place of publication
of all works cited is London.</p>

<p>A great many friends have contributed to the making of this book,
and almost as many librarians in the United States and England have
aided my researches for it. Some special debts I wish to record here.
Randolph G. Adams, Director of the William L. Clements Library at
Ann Arbor, Julian P. Boyd, Librarian of Princeton University, and
Professor George Sherburn of Harvard have read my manuscript and
given me helpful advice. W. S. Lewis, Esq., of Farmington, Connecticut,
kindly allowed me to quote from notes written by Horace Walpole in
a copy of <i>Anticipation</i> now in Mr. Lewis’ collection of Walpoliana;
Richard Eustace Tickell, Esq., of London, sent me useful material from
the Tickell family papers; Mrs. Flora V. Livingston and Mr. William
Van Lennep, curators, respectively, of the Widener Collection and the
Theatre Collection in the Harvard College Library, allowed me to quote
from manuscript letters in their charge; the New York Public Library
gave me permission to reproduce the title-page that precedes the text.
For aid in preparing the Bibliography of Tickell’s Writings I am most
indebted to Mr. John D. Gordan of the New York Public Library, who
read and ably criticized it; to Miss Anne S. Pratt of the Yale University
Library, and Mr. Frederick R. Goff of the Library of Congress,
who answered numerous bibliographical inquiries; to the Union Catalog
in the Library of Congress and its staff; and to the admirable <i>Bibliotheca
Americana</i>, begun by Joseph Sabin, continued by Wilberforce
Eames, and then completed by R. W. G. Vail, New York, 1868-1937.
The services of Herbert B. Anstaett, Librarian of Franklin and Marshall
College, have been so various, constant, and indispensable that they deserve
my most sincere thanks. No thanks, however, can be adequate for
the devoted work and interest bestowed on the preparation of this book,
from beginning to end, by my wife.</p>

the use of blanks and asterisks in names of persons was a means of avoiding libel
actions. One should never print a man’s name out at length, said Swift in <i>The
Importance of the Guardian Considered</i>, 1713; “but, as I do, that of Mr. St—le:
so that, although everybody alive knows whom I mean, the plaintiff can have no redress
in any court of justice.” This was such an easy way to add piquancy to defamation
that it became conventional in satire. In 1778 the reviewer of an anti-ministerial
poem called <i>The Conquerors</i> observed that the work seemed “designed

<h3><i>1</i></h3>

<p>Early in 1778 a new satirical poet caused a flutter in the polite circles
of London. Within a few weeks of one another two poems, <i>The Project</i>
and <i>The Wreath of Fashion</i>, were issued by Becket, the bookseller of
the Adelphi in the Strand. Though anonymous, their author was soon
known to be a young barrister named Richard Tickell. <i>The Project</i>
treats of a scheme overlooked by the Academy of Projectors which
Captain Gulliver visited in the course of his third voyage. In deft octosyllabics
the satirist proposes applying Montesquieu’s discovery of the
effect of climate on character to the problem of the parliamentary Opposition:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Suppose the Turks, who now agree</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It wou’d <i>fatigue</i> them to be free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should build an ice-house, to debate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More <i>cooly</i> on affairs of state,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might not some Mussulmen be brought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To brace their minds, nor shrink at thought?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Surely the philosophers are right who have reasoned that England’s
northern air is accountable for Englishmen’s love of liberty, and many
a question has been lost by Administration from Parliament’s meeting
in cold weather. An obvious solution would be to alter the season of
meeting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But ah, what honest squire would stay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make his <i>speech</i>, instead of <i>hay</i>?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The <i>Beaux</i> would scarcely think of law,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To give up <i>Scarborough</i> or <i>Spa’</i>:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And say ye <i>sportsmen</i>, wou’d a member</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Attend <i>St. Stephen’s</i> in September?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The poet’s more feasible plan is a better mode of heating the Parliament
buildings. He suggests that in each House, replacing the table<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
where votes, journals, and mace are laid, a vast “<i>Buzaglo</i>”<a id="Nanchor_1" href="#Note_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> be set up;
that is, an open fire of intense heat, over which a Fire Committee
should preside with a fuel supply of seditious tracts—<i>Junius</i>, <i>Common
Sense</i>, and the works of Tucker and Price. Such a device will mollify
the most inveterate foes of Administration:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">From bench to bench, in spite of gout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The soften’d <i>Chatham</i> moves about:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“My good <i>Lord Sandwich</i>, how d’ye do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I like the speech; ’twas penn’d by you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">America has gone too far;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We must support so just a war.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The reviewers were delighted with the poem, so distinguished by its
good nature and wit amid the current tide of party polemics. The
connoisseur in Horace Walpole was stronger than his Whiggism, and
he found <i>The Project</i> excellent.<a id="Nanchor_2" href="#Note_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Dr. Johnson, who disapproved of
flippancy in politics, dissented. At a dinner party at Sir Joshua Reynolds’
on the 25th of April, Dr. Samuel Musgrave, the learned editor of
Euripides, read the new poem. Johnson was not amused. “A temporary
poem always entertains us,” urged Musgrave. “So,” replied Johnson,
“does an account of the criminals hanged yesterday entertain us.”<a id="Nanchor_3" href="#Note_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Rather ungratefully, Tickell followed up his reception as a poet in
the circles of <i>ton</i> with a satire on one of society’s most conspicuous
foibles. <i>The Wreath of Fashion, or, the Art of Sentimental Poetry</i>,
said <i>The Critical Review</i> in its notice, “is levelled at the same vice in
the poetical world, at which the School for Scandal was aimed in the
theatrical and moral worlds,—at the present fashionable strain of sentimental
whining.”<a id="Nanchor_4" href="#Note_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It was an age of rhyming peers. Tickell declared
in the preface that he was prompted to write his satire by reading
a recent volume by a noble author (whom he did not name but
who was the Earl of Carlisle, Byron’s “Lord, rhymester, petit-maître,
pamphleteer”) containing one ode on the death of Mr. Gray and two
on the death of his lordship’s spaniel. In <i>The Wreath of Fashion</i> Tickell
deplored, with Sheridan, the vogue of tearful comedies and gently rebuked
the inanities of newspaper poets. His chief ridicule was reserved
for the poetic salon of Mrs. “Calliope” Miller at Batheaston, where the
quality from Bath wrote <i>bouts-rimés</i> about buttered muffins and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
like, dropped them into a classic vase, and applauded the winners
crowned by Mrs. Miller with wreaths of myrtle.<a id="Nanchor_5" href="#Note_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Over these rites of
poetic sensibility, said the satirist, the goddess Fashion presides, and thus
she must be supplicated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">On a spruce pedestal of <i>Wedgwood ware</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where motley forms, and tawdry emblems glare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold she consecrates to cold applause,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A Petrefaction, work’d into a <i>Vase</i>:</div>

<p class="noindent"><i>The Wreath of Fashion</i> went through a half-dozen editions. David
Garrick wrote a puff for it in <i>The Monthly Review</i> in which he ventured
to prophesy that “elegant poetry, refined satire, and exquisite
irony” would be revived by the new author;<a id="Nanchor_6" href="#Note_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and Samuel Rogers,
belated Augustan that he was, always remembered <i>The Wreath</i> as an
early favorite.<a id="Nanchor_7" href="#Note_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<h3><i>2</i></h3>

<p>Who was the new poet? The turn of his couplets and the delicate
barbs of his satire suggested a poetic school then growing outmoded.
There were those who, when they learned his name, remembered his
grandfather, Thomas Tickell, a poet of Queen Anne’s day and the
particular friend of Mr. Addison. Thomas Tickell (1685-1740) served
as Addison’s Under-Secretary of State and retained his post under Craggs
and Carteret. In 1724, when Carteret became Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,
Tickell was sent to Dublin as Secretary to the Lords Justices. There
were cordial relations between Dublin Castle and the Deanery of St.
Patrick’s, and a circle of friends that included Swift, the Delanys, Lord
Orrery, and Dr. Sheridan maintained in Dublin an outpost of Augustan
literary society. In this propitious atmosphere John Tickell, eldest son of
Thomas and father of Richard, our poet, was born in 1729 and grew
up to take his place among the Dublin <i>virtuosi</i>. But he had a volatile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
character and fell into a train of misadventures and difficulties. In 1748
he made a runaway marriage with Esther (or Hester) Pierson, and
children to the number of six followed in rapid succession.<a id="Nanchor_8" href="#Note_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> At length he
became disastrously involved in Anglo-Irish politics while serving on the
court side as a magistrate after the Dublin riots in December 1759.<a id="Nanchor_9" href="#Note_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> His
conduct on this occasion, though its precise nature is not clear, excited
such indignation that he was obliged to leave Dublin. In 1765, according
to information in the Tickell family papers, his mother purchased for
him a civil appointment at Windsor Castle; but some years later, like
other indigent Englishmen at that period, he went to live on the Continent
and disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>Richard, the second son of John Tickell, is usually said to have been
born at Bath in 1751, but neither the place nor the date can be verified.
He and his elder brother Thomas were briefly at Westminster School
(from 19 June 1764); when their father went to Windsor Castle, they
were transferred to Eton (29 May 1765); three years later Richard
proceeded to the Middle Temple (8 November 1768).<a id="Nanchor_10" href="#Note_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Having in due
time been called to the bar, he was, about the beginning of 1777, appointed
by Lord Chancellor Bathurst a commissioner of bankrupts. However,
as a contemporary biographer remarked, law was not to Tickell’s
taste; “his disposition was too volatile and desultory for that study.”<a id="Nanchor_11" href="#Note_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In
April or May 1778 he was removed from his post. Doubtless his courtship
of the muses had been at the expense of the law, for his fellow-commissioners
had complained of his absences. Tickell turned in his distress
to his most influential friend, David Garrick, who at once interceded
for him with the Lord Chancellor, by way of Lady Bathurst.<a id="Nanchor_12" href="#Note_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Garrick
obtained from Bathurst a promise of reinstatement, but in June Bathurst
was succeeded by Edward Thurlow, and Garrick had to begin all over
again. His further attempts met with no success. “I am sorry we were
both so unsuccessful in our Schems with the present Chancellor,” Garrick
was informed by Lady Bathurst on the 25th of July; “I do assure you
I did my part for Mʳ Tickle but I find he has enemies who flung cold
water on my solicitations.”<a id="Nanchor_13" href="#Note_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The news plunged Tickell into despair.</p>

<p>But Fortune is capricious, and at this moment Tickell made the acquaintance
of one who was even closer than Garrick to the springs of
patronage. This was William Brummell, whose only claim to remembrance
today is the fact that he had a very famous son, but who appears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
in late eighteenth-century memoirs as an able backstairs politician and
private secretary to Lord North. Brummell, we are informed by the
<i>Biographia Dramatica</i>, “conceived a strong friendship for our author,
and patronised him with a generosity and warmth that did him honour.”<a id="Nanchor_14" href="#Note_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
With the approval and perhaps at the instigation of Lord North, Tickell
was at once set to work on a secret and important project. On the 7th
of November he wrote Garrick pleading to be excused from writing a
prologue that had been requested of him:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">You may be assured Mr. Garrick’s wishes shall always have the
force of commands with me; but when I acquaint you that at
present ... I am employed in a work that may make or mar my
fortune, I can scarcely think you would wish to interrupt my attention
to it.<a id="Nanchor_15" href="#Note_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">On Monday the 23rd of that month, three days before Parliament met
for the new session, Becket announced the publication of a work entitled
“<i>ANTICIPATION</i>, Containing the Substance of his M⸻y’s
most gracious Speech to both H⸺s of P⸻t, on the Opening
of the approaching Session. Together with a full and authentic account
of the Debate in the H⸺ of C⸻, that will take place on the motion
for the address and amendment.” On Tuesday night Edward Gibbon
wrote his friend Holroyd:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You sometimes complain that I do not send you early news; but
you will now be satisfied with receiving a full and true account of
all the parliamentary transactions of <i>next</i> Thursday. In town we
think it an excellent piece of humour (the author is one Tickell).
Burke and C. Fox are pleased with their own Speaches, but serious
Patriots groan that such things should be turned to farce.<a id="Nanchor_16" href="#Note_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Horace Walpole, though unable to deny the wit of <i>Anticipation</i>, was
among those who thought its jocularity ill-timed. Said he:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The drollery of the pamphlet was congenial with the patron: a
very unprosperous and disgraceful civil war, just heightened by a
bloody proclamation of Sir Henry Clinton, and accompanied by a
war with France, was not a very decent moment for joking!<a id="Nanchor_17" href="#Note_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<h3><i>3</i></h3>

<p>No one in any party was disposed to deny the seriousness of the moment.
The preceding twelve months, as some were then aware, had
proved the turning-point in the war with America. The threat of French
aggression following Burgoyne’s defeat had transformed Britain’s war of
subjugation into one of defence. After a comfortable winter in Philadelphia,
without having struck a blow at the inferior American forces at
Valley Forge, Sir William Howe was ordered to evacuate that city lest
it be cut off by a French fleet. Englishmen at home could still cling to
the official view, held by George III and expressed by Lord North in
<i>Anticipation</i>, that most Americans, if given a chance to choose, would
prefer conciliation with England to an upstart democracy and an “unnatural
connection” with France. But those on the spot saw that the
hope of affording Americans such a chance was now dashed. At Philadelphia
Admiral Lord Howe’s secretary wrote in his journal on the 22nd
of May:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">I now look upon the Contest as at an End. No man can be expected
to declare for us, when he cannot be assured of a Fortnight’s Protection.
Every man, on the contrary, whatever might have been his
primary Inclinations, will find it his Interest to oppose &amp; drive us out
of the Country.<a id="Nanchor_18" href="#Note_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Two days later General Howe set sail for England and left Sir Henry
Clinton to evacuate the troops in June. The incompetence or treachery
of an American officer, Charles Lee, saved Clinton’s regiments from
severe losses as they crossed New Jersey. After their arrival within the
fortifications around New York, the British held not a square mile elsewhere
on the mainland of the northern and middle colonies.</p>

<p>The summer was occupied with raids by British irregulars on the Pennsylvania
and New York frontier and a series of inconclusive feints and
chases between Admirals Howe and D’Estaing. In September Howe
resigned his command and followed his brother home to England. Deeply
disgruntled with Administration, the Howes joined General Burgoyne
in efforts to obtain satisfaction from Parliament. The Whigs, hoping for
disclosures embarrassing to the government, at once took up the cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
of the commanders; while the ministers, with equal determination, resisted
every move for a court-martial or inquiry.</p>

<p>During this year the Tory government had been as hard pressed at
home as the King’s forces had been abroad. The news of Saratoga, received
early in December 1777, struck a staggering blow to the ministers,
who at once adjourned Parliament for six weeks and endeavored to open
indirect and secret negotiations with the American commissioners in Paris.
When Parliament reconvened, Fox’s motion in the Commons “that no
more of the Old Corps be sent out of the kingdom” produced a suddenly
swollen minority. There was a cry throughout the country for Chatham.
North had lost his zest for the war and would willingly have retired in
favor of Chatham, but the King refused to consider such a move. In a
desperate effort to counteract American negotiations with France, North
then introduced, 17 February 1778, his conciliatory bills, which offered
the repeal of the acts that had offended the colonists and conceded all but
the name of independence. While the House was recovering from its
amazement Charles Fox rose and said that he was glad Ministers had at
last concurred with the long-standing views of Opposition. But had not
their repentance come too late? Did not Ministers know that a commercial
treaty between France and America had already been signed?<a id="Nanchor_19" href="#Note_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> “Acts
of Parliament have made a war,” Walpole wrote Sir Horace Mann three
days later, “but cannot repeal one.”<a id="Nanchor_20" href="#Note_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> On the 13th of March the French
ambassador in London announced the treaty of friendship between France
and the United States. Thereafter no one in either party expected much
of North’s commission to treat with America. Detained in England until
mid-April, the commissioners arrived in the Delaware a whole month
after Congress had ratified the treaty with France and, to their great
chagrin, just in time to take part in the retreat from Philadelphia. One
member of the commission, George Johnstone, after futile private overtures
to members of Congress, quarreled with his colleagues and returned
in a huff to vindicate himself and criticize ministers and commanders before
Parliament. On the whole, the commission did little more than aggravate
the ill-feeling on both sides.</p>

<p>On the 7th of April, after a long absence, Lord Chatham, wrapped
in flannels and supported by his sons, took his seat in the House of Lords.
Rising for the second time in the debate to speak on the American war,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
he was struck down by an apoplexy from which he never recovered. His
death, on the 11th of May, was believed and said by many to be a portent
of doom to the Empire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the specter of a French invasion caused the King late in
March to communicate to Parliament his intention of ordering the militia
“to be drawn out and embodied, and to march as occasion shall require.”
Five encampments were established; peers and M.P.’s, Whig and Tory
alike, hastened to raise regiments; and by June Gibbon could tell Holroyd
that “The chief conversation at Almack’s is about tents, drill-Serjeants,
subdivisions, firings, &amp;c.”<a id="Nanchor_21" href="#Note_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> All summer and autumn the country was
full of marching and countermarching for the edification of anxious royalty.
In the newspapers appeared advertisements for “martial balsam,”
recommended for those afflicted by toothache from exposure to damp canvas
and mattresses. Even theater business was depressed by the rage for
visiting the encampments. Sheridan, ever resourceful, dashed off as a
counter-attraction his entertainment of <i>The Camp</i>, with a musical arrangement
by Thomas Linley, a prologue by Tickell, and (according
to the newspaper notices) “a perspective Representation of the <span class="smcap">grand
camp</span> at <span class="smcap">Coxheath</span>, from a view taken by Mr. de Loutherbourg and
erected under his direction.”</p>

<p>All this was diverting, but in midsummer occurred an incident that
betrayed to the nation the smoldering antagonism between ministers and
commanders. In the previous March Admiral Keppel, a staunch Whig
who had refused to serve against America, had been promoted commander
of the Channel fleet. He found, contrary to the Admiralty’s repeated
assurances in Parliament, that ships and equipment were woefully
inadequate for his crucial task of defending the coasts. At length reinforced,
Keppel on the 27th of July engaged the Brest fleet off Ushant.
In command of the British rearward squadron was Sir Hugh Palliser, a
Tory M.P. and a Lord of the Admiralty. Following a short and indecisive
action, Keppel gave orders for a new line of battle, but Palliser did
not obey until after dark. By morning the French had escaped. Keppel
did not report Palliser’s insubordination, but accounts of the action appeared
in the papers, and before the opening of Parliament the incident
had become a heated party issue, with Keppel exalted as a popular hero
and Palliser condemned as the agent of a negligent and scheming ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<h3><i>4</i></h3>

<p>Affairs stood in this critical posture when Parliament was summoned
in the last week of November. Fearing defection in the Tory
ranks, North called a private meeting of his friends beforehand to consult
on strategy. He was himself there taxed with negligence, and extraordinary
steps were taken to secure attendance in the government seats.
Now a favorite parliamentary weapon of North’s had always been humor—or,
as his opponents styled it, “buffoonery.” His motto, said Walpole,
ought to have been “<i>Aut dormitabo, aut ridebo</i>.”<a id="Nanchor_22" href="#Note_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And when <i>Anticipation</i>
appeared, it was widely believed that North himself had had
a hand in its composition.<a id="Nanchor_23" href="#Note_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The very favorable reception of the pamphlet
must have surpassed the hopes of both author and patron. For some days
the papers printed eulogistic notices and long extracts. Representative is
the comment in <i>The Morning Chronicle</i> on the day the session opened:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The literary piece of mimickry published on Monday last, under
the title of <i>Anticipation</i>, is beyond compare one of the ablest sketches
ever hit off by a man of fancy and talents. Mimicks in general distort
the features of those they affect to imitate; the author of <i>Anticipation</i>,
on the contrary, has preserved the <i>vrais-semblance</i> of each of
the objects of imitation with wonderful correctness, and it is a question
whether he deserves most applause for the humorous conceits
with which he has dished out the oratory of his heroes, or the striking
likenesses (in point of order, argument, imagery, and diction) which
he has drawn of each speaker. Lord G[ranb]y’s harangue is, to
those who have not been in the House of Commons on the first day
of a session, a perfect example of Opposition oratory on such an occasion.—Mr.
T. L[uttre]ll’s speech need not have had his name
prefixed to it; no member, T. L[uttre]ll excepted, could possibly
shew so much learning to so little purpose.... In a word,
<i>Anticipation</i> is one of the best pamphlets the publick have been favoured
with for years, and though it has in some measure a political
tendency, ... it serves, contrary to the effect of most political
pamphlets, to put all parties in good humour.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The good nature of the parody was remarked by all who spoke of it. Certainly
the pleasantest circumstance of the whole episode is the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
some of the victims of Tickell’s mimicry enjoyed the humor of it; though
we learn from Walpole that Welbore Ellis, “another justly and humourously
drawn, proved how justly. He said, ‘It is well written, but I perceive
the author takes me for a dull man.’”<a id="Nanchor_24" href="#Note_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>According to a tradition that is not implausible, North and his friends
took copies of <i>Anticipation</i> into the House on the opening day and dispensed
them gratis.<a id="Nanchor_25" href="#Note_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> An apparent consequence of this was Tickell’s luckiest
satirical stroke, by virtue of which <i>Anticipation</i> lived on in the memory
of anecdotists. Walpole, who was on the spot, reported that Col. Isaac
Barré, an Opposition stalwart, “not having seen this pamphlet, the first
day of the Session cited a foreign Governor with whom he was acquainted,
exactly in the manner here ridiculed, and he also translated a French
expression.”<a id="Nanchor_26" href="#Note_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> This episode grew appreciably in the telling. In 1823 Joseph
Jekyll told Tom Moore (who wrote down everything he heard) of
the</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">laughable effect on the House of Col. Barré’s speech; he being the
only one (having just arrived from the country) ignorant of the
pamphlet, and falling exactly into the same peculiarities which the
pamphlet quizzed, particularly that of quoting French words and
then translating them. At every new instance of this kind in his
speech there was a roar of laughter from the House, which Barré,
of course, could not understand.<a id="Nanchor_27" href="#Note_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But this was not the last refinement. The progress of the story, from
contemporary witnesses to Jekyll and Moore and finally to “Senex” writing
his recollections in <i>Blackwood’s</i> in 1826, is an illustration and a warning
of the ways of anecdotists. The humorous success of <i>Anticipation</i>,
wrote “Senex,”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">I well remember.... The style of the speeches was so well imitated,
and the matter in many cases so happily forestalled, that, like
Vulcan among Homer’s gods, it caused inextinguishable laughter.
What gave much zest to the joke was the ignorance of most of the
usual speaking members that any such pamphlet existed. Their great
surprise at the loud mirth excited by speeches intended to make a very
different impression, and the frequent cries of “Spoke, Spoke!” the
meaning of which they could not possibly comprehend, may be easily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
conceived. One of its effects was to shorten the debate, for, as
the joke soon spread, many were afraid to address the House for
fear of involving themselves in the predicament of those who had
been so humorously anticipated.<a id="Nanchor_28" href="#Note_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

</div>

<h3><i>5</i></h3>

<p><i>Anticipation</i> had a great run. Such was the popular demand that a
“Fourth Edition” was advertised by Becket within a week of first publication.
Five more London editions and a Dublin reprint appeared before
the end of the year. As soon as copies reached America, <i>Anticipation</i> was
reprinted at both the British headquarters in New York and the American
headquarters in Philadelphia. In announcing his New York reprint, James
Rivington stated, with what degree of exaggeration the reader is free to
guess, that “such was the reception given to this novel and immensely
admired piece, that more than <i>Forty Thousand</i> copies were disposed of
in a few days.”<a id="Nanchor_29" href="#Note_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In London a rash of imitations broke out at once. <i>Altercation</i>,
<i>Deliberation</i>, <i>Anticipation Continued</i>, <i>Anticipation for the Year
MDCCLXXIX</i>, <i>The Exhibition, or a Second Anticipation</i>—all these
appeared within a year. As late as 1812 appeared <i>Anticipation: or, The
Prize Address; which will be delivered at the Opening of the New
Drury Lane Theatre</i>, a squib inspired by the same circumstances that gave
rise to the celebrated <i>Rejected Addresses</i> of James and Horace Smith.
And there were others. But, as Dr. Johnson remarked of <i>The Splendid
Shilling</i>, “the merit of such performances begins and ends with the first
author.”<a id="Nanchor_30" href="#Note_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>There was another result of the publication of the satire that, to Tickell,
was perhaps the most gratifying of all. The author was right, observed
<i>The London Magazine</i> in its review, in predicting a majority for Administration
in his mimic debate; “and we verily believe he might have
added by way of note at the end—‘This will get me a place or a pension.’”<a id="Nanchor_31" href="#Note_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
This impertinence was justified by the event. On the 6th of
December Richard Rigby, Paymaster and general factotum in North’s
cabinet, wrote David Garrick a short but meaningful note: “I have had
a meeting with <i>Anticipation</i>, and like him very much; I wish to have
some further discourse with you upon that subject. Could you call here
to-morrow morning about eleven?”<a id="Nanchor_32" href="#Note_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The subject was unquestionably a
ministerial reward for services rendered. About this time Tickell was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
granted a pension of 200<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.<a id="Nanchor_33" href="#Note_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Soon afterward an anonymous
poet of the Batheaston circle returned good for evil in praising Tickell
while attempting to recall him to virtue:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Some writers be of an amphibious race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And prose and verse their elemental place.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such he, whose wit made wond’ring senates roar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And those to blush that never blush’d before.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Anticipation</i> gave him sterling fame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>The Wreath of Fashion</i> a poetic name.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Nature gave, and at the gift repines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At pension’d wit and prostituted lines.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be your’s, O <i>Tickell</i>, to correct this vice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That deals out praise or censure at a price,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in one grand example prove to men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How weak is Wit, when Party holds the pen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And while you glow with more than virtue’s flame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all admire from whence such virtue came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each literary Swiss shall dread thy rage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dismiss their weapons, and no more engage.<a id="Nanchor_34" href="#Note_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But man cannot live by wit alone. In the next two years Tickell wrote
two more satirical tracts for the ministry, which, though not dull, were
scarcely inspired; and in August 1781 he was appointed a commissioner
of the Stamp Office. Here, with other beneficiaries of ministerial generosity
and a salary of 500<i>l.</i>, he stayed. A year earlier (25 July 1780) he
had married Miss Mary Linley, a charming and witty young lady if less
renowned than her sister Elizabeth (Mrs. Richard Brinsley Sheridan). In
September 1782, doubtless through the good offices of Lord North, they
settled in an apartment in the Gold Staff Gallery at the top of Hampton
Court Palace.<a id="Nanchor_35" href="#Note_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Tickell’s talents were useful in the Linley-Sheridan family
enterprise of Drury Lane Theatre. He served in the capacity of Mr.
Puff as “a Practitioner of Panegyric” in the newspapers, refurbished old
plays, and tried his hand, with mild success, at composing librettos. When
Fox and North formed their coalition government (of unhappy memory),
Tickell’s political allegiance was transferred to the Whigs. That
he had long had a preference for Whig society appears from the satirical-affectionate
picture of Brooks’s Club in his <i>Epistle from the Honourable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Charles Fox, Partridge-Shooting, to the Honourable John Townshend,
Cruising</i>, 1779. The devoted but sharp-tongued Mrs. Tickell informed
her sister in a letter of 1785: “So I find the election has taken a happy
turn at last and I am to congratulate myself with being the wife of a
member of Brooks’s.... T. is delighted; the great point of his ambition
is gained.”<a id="Nanchor_36" href="#Note_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> To which she added, at the thought of her husband’s
increased opportunities for conviviality: “Farewell, a long farewell to all
my comforts.”<a id="Nanchor_37" href="#Note_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> From the many fragments of Mary Tickell’s spritely
letters that have been printed here and there, it is impossible not to give
at least one representative passage showing both husband and wife in
character. In an undated letter from Hampton Court she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The men stayed last night or rather this morning till four or five
tho’ I entreated T⸺. to think of to-night’s fatigue for me and
let them go, but ’twas all in vain, for the moment my back was
turn’d off they march’d into the other room with their Bottles and
Glasses and order’d Stephen to bring the fire after them—so at
least they had the grace to think of not disturbing me, for you
are to know since the cold wether we dine and sup in the Drawing
Room. However unfortunately my ears were quick enough to reach
to Stephen’s Pantry where I heard every cruel Pop of that odious
five shilling claret which entirely hindered my closing my eyes, so
here I am at half past one just after breakfast and thinking of my
evening’s dissipation. Don’t you think that I should cut a figure in
the great world?<a id="Nanchor_38" href="#Note_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As a member of the glittering Whig fraternity that moved about Fox,
Sheridan, and the Prince of Wales, Tickell became a large contributor
to the great collective (and perennial) satire known as <i>The Rolliad</i>, a
shilling edition of which, George Saintsbury once remarked, if properly
annotated, would keep one amused from London to York. He also produced
a number of more or less serious pamphlets attacking Pitt’s government;
and during the regency crisis of 1788-89 he worked feverishly
with the other Foxites in the expectation of a Whig triumph. But the
King recovered, the Whigs’ hopes were dashed, and Tickell never obtained
his expected seat in Parliament.<a id="Nanchor_39" href="#Note_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Mary Tickell died in July 1787. Two years later Tickell eloped with
the daughter of a captain in the East India Company’s service, Miss Sarah<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Ley, a reigning beauty who was for a time the rival of Emma Hamilton
as Romney’s model.<a id="Nanchor_40" href="#Note_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> She was very young, very extravagant, and without
any fortune. In a year or two her husband, who was chronically improvident
and was now deprived of Mary Tickell’s common sense, found
himself overwhelmed with debts. In May 1793 he appealed to Warren
Hastings for a loan of 500<i>l.</i> and obtained it.<a id="Nanchor_41" href="#Note_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Hastings was a friend of
the Ley family, but that an intimate of the Fox-Sheridan circle and a
contributor to <i>The Rolliad</i> should have turned to him for help is an indication
of Tickell’s desperate straits. The loan was evidently not sufficient
for his needs. On the 4th of November his lifeless body was found below
the parapet outside his Hampton Court apartment. Two days later Joseph
Farington recorded in his <i>Diary</i>: “Distressed circumstances and an apprehension
of being arrested, it is said, is the cause of this momentary
phrenzy.”<a id="Nanchor_42" href="#Note_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<h3><i>6</i></h3>

<p>As a successful parody of parliamentary proceedings and eloquence at
the time of the American Revolution, <i>Anticipation</i> retains historical interest.
One reviewer went so far as to say that a comparison of the actual
debate with Tickell’s anticipated version would show that between the
two “the difference as to the material grounds of disputation is trifling.”<a id="Nanchor_43" href="#Note_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
This is scarcely an exaggeration, though, as it turned out, the House was
less full and the debate less animated than had been expected from the
presence in town of so many generals and admirals known to be at odds
with one another and the ministers. As a parodist, however, Tickell was
less concerned to present the substance of a particular debate than the
idiosyncracies of those who spoke frequently in the House, whether from
Opposition or Administration benches. The verisimilitude of his subjects’
accents, attitudes, and hobby-horses of theme was unanimously acknowledged
and praised by contemporaries. <i>Anticipation</i> is in short a speaking
picture of that House of Commons in which, as well as in America, a bitter
conflict was in progress. Here are Burke’s rumbling periods on the decline
of the British Empire, and Fox’s skilful arguments to show that neither
an offensive nor a defensive war can be successfully continued in America.
David Hartley the younger quotes the recent sentiments of his friend
Benjamin Franklin in Paris, and a radical Member from the City praises
Washington and threatens ministers with the Tower and the block.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Other Whigs attack profiteering army contractors, false news in the
<i>Gazettes</i>, and the employment of Indians to butcher the colonists; others
demand parliamentary inquiries that government officials suggest deferring
until “about six months after Christmas.” Late in the evening Lord
North rises and, after invoking the mighty shade of Chatham, takes up
his secretary’s notes on speeches by the Opposition and urges upon an
unruly House the need of unanimity.</p>

<p>It is a vivid and authentic picture, and it is also an entertaining one.
Though parody is a minor genre, it has its masterpieces. But they should
be read rather than talked about. Let the last opinion on <i>Anticipation</i> be
that of George IV, who was a person of discernment in these matters.
J. W. Croker recorded in his diary that at a royal dinner-party in January
1822 the talk had turned to Tickell. The King spoke of <i>Anticipation</i>
“<i>con amore</i> and quoted some of the speeches.” He promised to have a
copy looked out for Lady Conyngham, who had never read it. “The
events and the pieces were gone by,” said the King; “but the wit and
pleasantry of it never could fade.”<a id="Nanchor_44" href="#Note_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

Æsop, Phædrus, or Joe Miller, or some other book equally distinguished

<p>Several reasons concurred to urge the Editor to this publication.
The critical situation of public affairs seemed to require an extraordinary
diffusion of political knowledge; yet, in the common course,
but few of the millions, who are so deeply interested in the result
of parliamentary debates, can be admitted to an audience of them.
Sometimes, the Members shut their galleries against the intrusion
of any of their Constituents; and it is always a standing order,
from the opening of the session, to prohibit the publication of their
debates. Under these circumstances, an authentic account of the
first day’s debate, put forth at this date, will clearly avoid any breach
of that order, and, without exposing the Constituents to crowding
in the gallery, to furnish them with their Representatives Speeches,
taken down with the strictest fidelity, cannot but afford them some
amusement, and indeed real use. Besides, the first day’s debate is
generally a kind of outline of the debates of the whole session; so
that a critical observer, by contemplating the buds and seedlings of
this early eloquence, may calculate what degree of radical strength
they possess, how far they will expand and bloom, and whether they
are hardy enough to stand the winter.</p>

<p>The Editor cannot but seize this opportunity to thank those Gentlemen
who have furnished him with the <i>most authentic materials</i>
for some of the speeches, which, they will immediately see, he has
copied <i>verbatim</i> from their manuscripts—and he sincerely hopes,
their having appeared in print <i>before</i> they are spoken, will not deter
the several Gentlemen from delivering them with their usual appearance
of <i>extempore</i> eloquence.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dom. Comm. Jovis. 26 Nov. die.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Anno 19ᵒ Georgii III Regis, 1778.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Sir Francis M[olyneu]x, gentleman-usher of the black rod, having,
with the usual solemnity, at half past two o’clock, given three
admonitory raps at the door of the H[ous]e of C[ommo]ns, and
being thereupon admitted, and having proceeded towards the table,
with three progressive bows, acquainted the S[peake]r,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that his
M[ajest]y commanded their immediate attendance in the H[ous]e
of L[or]ds, where soon after his M[ajest]y delivered his most gracious
speech to both Houses; which we should give at length, having
an accurate copy now before us, but that many reasons concur
to induce us rather to give a general sketch of it. It is scarcely necessary
to say, that respect to that great personage is the principal of
those motives: It is also universally felt, that the merit of those
speeches consists much less in the composition than in the delivery.
Besides, as an authentic <i>black letter</i> copy of <i>this</i> speech will infallibly
appear, we have too high a respect for our good friends Messrs. the
Hawkers and Criers of this great metropolis, to rob them of any
part of the fruits of their annual eloquence on this occasion⸺The
speech began by saying,</p>

<p>That the situation of public affairs induced him to call them thus
early together, that they might more fully enter into the various
and important concerns which would naturally engage their attention.</p>

<p>That he had reason to hope that the schemes which the natural
enemies of this country, in conjunction with their unnatural allies,
had meditated against us in the West-Indies, notwithstanding some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
appearance of success, might, under Divine Providence, fail in the
object of distressing the commercial interest of his people, which,
it gave him satisfaction to observe, had hitherto continued to flourish
amidst the calamities of war, while that of the enemy had received
the most material injuries.</p>

<p>That he could not but behold with particular pleasure the zeal
and ardour shewn by all his subjects on this emergency, which had
fully secured the safety of this country, and convinced our enemies
that every attempt against the internal prosperity of Great Britain
must prove ineffectual.</p>

<p>That he continued to receive the most friendly assurances of the
pacific dispositions of the other powers of Europe.</p>

<p>That his desire of re-establishing the general tranquility could
not be doubted; and as he had not been the first to disturb the
peace, so he should embrace the earliest opportunity of putting an
end to the horrors of war, whenever that desirable end could be
effected, consistently with the honour of his crown, and the interest
of his subjects, which he should ever be careful to preserve.</p>

<p>That his faithful C[o]mm[o]ns might depend on the proper
officers immediately laying before them the estimate for the expences
of the ensuing year.</p>

<p>That he lamented that the present situation of affairs should
oblige him to call upon his faithful subjects for any additional supplies,
but</p>

<p>That his faithful C[o]mm[o]ns might depend on the strictest
œconomy on his part, in the application of such sums as they should
judge necessary for the public service, and he doubted not they
would see the expediency of providing for such contingencies as
might arise from the continuance of war, and the measures necessary
to be taken for the re-establishment of peace upon an honourable
and permanent foundation.</p>

<p>It concluded with relying on the wisdom and unanimity of Parliament;
on the good conduct of his Generals and Admirals; on
the valor of his Fleets and Armies; and on the zeal and spirit of
all his faithful subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>Upon the return of the C[ommo]ns to their House, the speech
having been read as usual from the chair, a motion for an Address,
conformable to the several sentences in the speech, and expressive
of the firmness and unanimity of the House at this important crisis,
was made and seconded by two young Members; the particular
phraseology of which leading speeches we shall not retail, it being
universally admitted that the rhetoric applied to these occasions, is
not very replete with originality. Our readers will easily imagine
the proper quantity of tropes and metaphors, apologies for inexperience,
elegant timidities, graceful blushes, studied hesitations, army
safe at New-York, fleets likewise safe, individuals enriched, perfect
content at home, nothing wanting but unanimity in council, &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c. which ornamented and enriched these anniversary panegyrics.
We shall hasten therefore to the more material part of the debate,
which commenced by the following speech from Lord G[ranb]y<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
proposing the amendment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord G[ran]by.</div>

<p><i>Lord G[ran]by.</i> Conscious of my own inability, and sinking
under the sense of my little knowledge or experience, totally unprovided
with any ideas for the present occasion, and absolutely
ignorant not only of the forms but even the modes of proceeding
in this house, may I, Sir, in this state of imbecility, be permitted
to take the lead on this first and most important day of the session?
May I, Sir, all unequal to so arduous a task, be allowed to dictate,
if not to the whole house, at least to this side of it, the proper and
only constitutional method of compelling ministers to furnish us
with the means of discovering some errors in their conduct; and
to enable us to demonstrate to the nation at large their total incapacity
for filling the places which they now hold?—There was
a time, Sir, when this side of the house would not tamely acquiesce
in so dangerous a precedent as any minister’s retaining his
office for the unconstitutional duration of seven years. Have we
forgot, Sir, the great name of Pulteny? Pulteny, Sir! the virtuous
Pulteny! Pulteny, the wonder of the age! Pulteny, that steady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Patriot, whose Herculean eloquence overcame the Hydra of corruption!
or have we forgot, Sir, that inestimable character of our
own times, whose virtues compelled the admiration of this profligate
age; whose memory excites the veneration of every patriot mind?
Let it not be objected that these illustrious characters were dazzled
by the splendour of a coronet: I will not answer such frivolous
remarks:—Sir, I wander from the question: Yet let me remind this
House, that those great patriots were ever foremost in taking that
part which now falls to my lot. They, Sir, were ever ready to
awaken the fears, and rouze the apprehensions, of the Country
Gentlemen; and that, Sir, is my object:—They, Sir, compelled
Adm[i]n[i]str[a]t[io]n to disclose the inmost recess of official iniquity;
and that, Sir, that is also my intention. Sir, with this
view, I shall humbly move you, that in place of the present Address,
which I cannot but consider as the selfish panegyric of
Adm[i]n[i]str[a]t[io]n, immediately after the general expressions
of respect for his M[ajest]y, the following words may be substituted,
in order to our acquiring that full and comprehensive
knowledge of public affairs, which is so indispensably necessary at
the opening of this interesting and important session of P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt.</p>

<p>“Your faithful C[o]mm[o]ns, deeply impressed with a sense of
your M[ajest]y’s unwearied anxiety to promote the dignity and
glory of Great Britain, cannot but lament the many unhappy circumstances
which have conspired to disturb your M[ajest]y’s happiness,
and to prejudice the interests and honour of this country.
When we find that the most liberal supplies for our naval equipments
have as yet produced none of those happy effects which might reasonably
have been expected to be derived from so powerful an
armament, particularly under the direction of an officer of experienced
conduct and courage, we cannot but express our serious
apprehensions of some fatal misconduct, either on the part of Administration,
by forming indecisive and contradictory instructions
for the direction of the Navy, or, in the particular department for
naval affairs, of some misapplication of those liberal supplies, which,
if wisely and faithfully applied, could not have failed, under divine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
providence, and your M[ajest]y’s wisdom, of obtaining the most
salutary effects.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we, your M[ajest]y’s most faithful C[o]mm[o]ns,
most humbly intreat your M[ajest]y to order the proper
Officers to lay before the House, copies of the secret instructions
for the conduct of the Fleet commanded by Admiral K[e]pp[e]l—estimates
of the quantity of ballast used in the several ships of
the division of the fleet commanded by Admiral K[e]pp[e]l—bills
of parcel of the number of square yards of sail-cloth, together with
samples of ditto, intended to be used in the division of the Fleet commanded
by Vice Admiral Sir H[u]gh P[a]ll[i]s[e]r—succinct
accounts of the quota of biscuits, and ratio of salt-beef distributed
in the Fleet—faithful transcripts of the several Log-Books of
each vessel—abstracts of all letters, notes, and messages that passed
and repassed, off Ushant, between the Admirals and Ph[i]l[i]p
St[e]v[e]ns, Esq. during the course of last summer—and, finally,
minute copies of all accounts unsettled or passed, open or closed,
paid or unpaid, between the Commissioners of the Navy, and all
sorts of Manufacturers, Sailors, Contractors, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. employed
by them for these twenty years last past⸺It is from a minute
investigation of these important papers, that your M[ajest]y’s most
faithful C[o]mm[o]ns can alone derive just grounds for censure
or exculpation. And, however laborious this investigation may prove,
we, your M[ajest]y’s most faithful C[o]mm[o]ns, beg leave to
assure your M[ajest]y, we shall most readily devote our utmost attention
to so salutary a study, in order to promote a quick dispatch
of public business at this momentous and aweful crisis, and to give
vigour and effect to those measures which your M[ajest]y, in your
great wisdom, may think necessary to secure the safety, interest, and
honour of Great Britain.”</p>

<p>Such, Sir, is the amendment which I have the honour to offer
to the consideration of this house. It will immediately strike you,
Sir, that in the accounts which I propose to have submitted to the
investigation of P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt, I have avoided asking for one
scrap of paper that is not absolutely necessary to be seen and thoroughly
studied by the House. Should it, however, appear necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
to Gentlemen to <i>add</i> to the list of these official documents, I am sure
I shall not oppose such an improvement to the motion, to whatever
quantity it may extend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. G[eor]g[e] S[u]tt[o]n.</div>

<p>Mr. <i>G[eo]rg[e] S[u]tt[o]n</i> seconded the motion for the
amendment, beginning with a similar acknowledgement of his incapacity,
his inexperience and ignorance of P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt[a]ry
affairs; declining therefore to enter into any further argument, the
subject having been discussed in so full and able a manner by his
most noble cousin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. W[e]lb[o]re Ell[i]s.</div>

<p>Mr. <i>W[e]lb[o]re Ell[i]s</i>, in reply, threw out many sagacious
and novel observations. He said that he highly commended the
caution and circumspection of the noble Lord, but, that in his opinion,
a more proper time would arrive, about six months after
Christmas, for entering into the details proposed by the Amendment;
as, at that period, Administration would certainly have more
leisure for furnishing the papers now called for.</p>

<p>He very properly observed, that selecting these few curious articles
of political intelligence from a variety of miscellaneous papers,
would require some short time, together with no small degree of
discernment, not to mention several thousands of extra clerks. He
said, he had taken the trouble to make a most serious investigation
into the Journals, the Votes, the Debates, and all the P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt[a]ry
Records of this country; and he was free to say, that
notwithstanding it might at first appear rather a novel idea, yet it
was his opinion, that <i>The Address</i> on the first day was a matter of
compliment. Nay, touching the matter before him, (and weighty
and powerful indeed it was) after the most mature and serious deliberation,
daily and nightly, he would for once venture to hazard
a rhetorical, a figurative expression, to wit, that the Address was an
eccho, as it were, a complimentary eccho, of his M[ajest]y’s most
gracious speech.—He hinted, that, if any Gentleman wished for
particular enquiries, he would, as an old Member, long conversant
with the forms of the House, tell him, that certainly a Committee
might be appointed to carry on any public enquiry; and he believed
such Committees were not unfrequent.—And here he remarked,
that, from all his researches, it appeared to him, that the constitution
of this country was of a triple nature—K[i]ng—L[o]rds—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
C[o]mm[o]ns—that, these three opposite and repelling
powers, reciprocally ballanced and counteracted each other; at the
same time that they contributed to the proportion and harmony
of the whole.—He took occasion to observe, that freedom of Debate
was clearly a P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt[a]ry privilege, and he would
pledge himself to prove that every Member in that House was a
representative of his constituents.</p>

<p>For these reasons, he concluded with dissenting from the Amendment
as trite, abstruse, dangerous, and frivolous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">D[a]v[i]d H[a]rtly, Esq.</div>

<p><i>D[a]v[i]d H[a]rtly</i>, Esq.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> observed, that these were no times
for flattery and empty adulation.—For his part, he should enter at
large into the rise and origin of all Colonies, ancient and modern,
into the history of Taxation, and its effects on every state that had
exercised it over its colonies; and then review the cause, commencement,
and conduct of the whole American war. He felt how arduous,
how complicated a task this must prove to himself, and how
difficult for the House to understand. That, to lessen that difficulty,
both to the House and to himself, he would adopt the most logical
method to give clearness and perspicuity to such a multitude and
diversity of ideas; and for that purpose, he begged Gentlemen to
take notice, that he should divide his speech into four and twenty
grand divisions, each of which should contain as many subdivisions,
which subdivisions should also be separately discussed in equal number
of sections, each section to be split also into the same number of
heads; so that with grand divisions, subdivisions, sections, and
heads, the number of distinct propositions would amount to several
thousands; but that Gentlemen, by attending closely, and correctly
taking down the number of any particular argument, should have
an immediate explicit answer to any query touching that individual
number: and he flattered himself this numerical logic and arithmetic
of eloquence would greatly tend to clarify their understandings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>To follow this gentleman thro’ even one of his grand divisions,
was a task much beyond the utmost rapidity of a short-hand writer.
Indeed the noise from all parts of the house was so excessive, during
the several hours which he engrossed in this laborious harangue, that
it was totally impossible to catch up any thing beyond the mutilated
fragments, and ruins of his oratory. At length however the house
sunk into a sudden calm, upon the disclosure of a fact, which seemed
to startle even the wildest zealots of faction.—For, after every
other argument was exhausted to so little purpose, inflamed by disappointment,
and hurried, as we are willing to suppose, by the violence
of patriotism, the Honourable Gentleman avowed to the
House, that one of his grounds for denouncing ruin to his country
was <i>his private knowledge of <span class="smcap">Dr. Franklyn’s</span> sentiments on
that head</i>.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> “Dr. Franklyn (he exclaimed) the Cromwell of his
age, Dr. Franklyn, Ambassador Plenipotentiary from America to
France, is my most intimate and most cordial friend!”⸺He
went on by declaring, he had passed great part of the summer at
Paris, with Dr. Franklyn, in the most unreserved communication
of sentiments and facts; and he concluded with repeating, as the
joint result of his own and Dr. Franklin’s deliberation, that the
glory of England was destroyed for ever!⸺This extraordinary
confession produced however no violent effect. Ministers seemed to
receive it with a contemptuous pity, not unmingled with ridicule,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
when <i>Mr. W[ilke]s</i>, finding the little success of serious treason,
rose, and indulged himself in the more ludicrous stile of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. W[ilke]s.</div>

<p><i>Mr. W[ilke]s</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> adverted with some degree of humour to the
inference of victory and triumph which might be deduced from the
return of our Generals and our Admirals, and one of our commissioners
too. They found (he said) that being on the spot interrupted
their manœuvres, and he supposed they were come three thousand
miles off to act <i>cooly</i>. That, the object they were sent to accomplish
was confessedly a great one; and it is well known, that objects of
a certain magnitude are best contemplated at a distance. Probably,
their optics were too tender to distinguish with accuracy amidst the
smoak and confusion incident to actual engagements; or perhaps,
they reflected on the more imminent dangers of domestic invasion,
and hastened home from pure patriotism to guard their native country.—At
any rate, he must compliment their discernment in pursuing
a line of conduct, which could not fail of conciliating the good
opinion and sympathetic regard of the Noble Lord, who presided
in the American department. If therefore, Mr. Speaker, by any
miraculous change, I were, this day, to become the Advocate of
Administration, I should mark the inutility of recurring to the written
evidence, which the Amendment calls for, at a moment when
we are so copiously provided with <i>vivâ voce</i> testimony. Yet, Sir, I
do not think, upon reflexion, that Ministers will adopt this ground
for rejecting the noble Lord’s Amendment. They, Sir, will more
boldly tell you—you shall have neither,—for, in these times, it is
the fashion for all modern Statesmen, first to tell their own story,
and then protest solemnly against being cross-examined—<i>or directly,
or indirectly, answering question, query, or otherwise</i>. I believe
I am accurate in my quotation.—I am not indeed surprized
at these declarations of obstinate silence—this is Scottish policy—the
example was set by my good old friend, the E[a]rl of B[u]te—for
therein I am orthodox in my faith, that the Son is equal to the
Father; and I am sure I may add with Athanasian zeal, the father
is incomprehensible, and the Son is incomprehensible, yet there are
not two incomprehensibles, but one incomprehensible.</p>

<p class="hanging">(Here a confused cry of order, and the Chaplain reprimanded
for laughing.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>There is indeed one North Briton of whom I entertain a better
hope.—He seems to have caught that itch for liberty, which, to
our great wonder, broke out in the Highlands last summer. He, Sir,
even in the character of his M[ajest]y’s Commissi[o]ner, solicited
the intimacy of <i>General Washington</i>. But indeed, Sir, if ever a
Scotchman can be suspected of loving liberty, it is not when he has
recently become a convert to Administration: <i>Washington</i> therefore
sent his Excellency, the worthy Commissioner, a flat refusal.—Mr.
<i>Laurens</i> too refused his Excellency the hearing he so generously
solicited by imploring Congress, “<i>not to follow the example
of Br[i]t[ai]n in the hour of her insolence</i>;” the <i>hearing</i> was however
refused, nay even the “<i>sight of the country</i>,” and “<i>the sight of
its worthy patriots</i>” was peremptorily refused. The Americans, Sir,
think that a Scotchman has neither eyes nor ears for liberty, or, at
least, they distrusted the capacity of his Excellency’s organs for such
an object.—I have a letter, Sir, in my pocket from my honest friend
Ethan Allen; I would read it, but I am sure you won’t let me:
He knows I am fond of scripture quotations, and tells me Congress
would have given your Scotch commissioner this <i>hearing</i>, but
they knew “he was like unto the deaf adder, who regardeth not the
voice of the charmer.”</p>

<p>Let me then trouble his Excellency with one question; who was
it suggested this secret correspondence with the enemy? was it not
the Scottish secretary of this wise commission, Dr. Adam Ferguson?
It must have been one of Sir John Dalrymple’s associates in
literature. The Scotch, if they can get no Englishman to act, as
they pretend to say the great Sidney did, will make even their own
countrymen treacherous in one age, to furnish some literary assassin
of the next with the foul vouchers of treachery and baseness. At all
events, Sir, I shall heartily give my vote for the amendment, as the
only means to convict the M[i]n[i]stry of what I know they are
guilty, weakness, incapacity, ignorance, obstinacy, baseness, and
treachery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Governor J[o]hns[o]n.</div>

<p><i>Governor J[o]hns[o]n</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> now rose, and said every thing that
a Gentleman in his melancholly situation could be supposed to urge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Spoke much of the want of candour in putting a false construction
on his actions, which he could assure the House, upon his honour,
were all dictated by the best intentions; that he should not undertake
to enter into a full defence of his conduct at present, as it was
a very delicate business, and turned upon a very nice chain of circumstances.
One part of the charges against him he would slightly
touch upon, his letters, and what he supposed was meant to be
hinted at, his attempts of bribery. That the artful policy of France
had made it necessary for him to parry her attacks by similar weapons;
that he believed it was felt and would be admitted by all parts
of that House, that there is no greater spring of public actions, in all
political assemblies, than <i>self-interest</i>. That he felt himself justified
in his own mind for every step he had taken, for he would venture
to affirm, that in every negociation true wisdom and sound policy
justified the moral fitness of secret articles, and the honourable expediency
of powerful temptations. As to the failure of success, on
the part of the commissioners, various causes had concurred to occasion
it. They were sent to treat of peace with a retreating army.
Philadelphia, the chief residence of the moderate men, and most
friendly to their negociation, was evacuated by the army, on the
Commissioners arrival. A little after they had got to New-York,
Mons. D’Estaign was upon the coast. These circumstances gave
spirits to a declining cause; and America, <i>in this hour of her insolence</i>,
refused to treat, unless her independence was specifically acknowledged.</p>

<p>What followed afterwards is a very serious business, indeed; but
I trust I shall be pardoned by a noble Lord opposite to me, high in
character, and in the esteem of his country, if I freely say, as my
opinion, that Monsieur D’Estaign’s fleet ought to have been attacked
by the Br[i]t[i]sh at Rhode-Island, as soon as the French
came out of the harbour to fight them. And I will further say, considering
the spirit, the gallantry, and the heroism of the British Seamen,
the inequality of the force of the fleets was not sufficient to
justify the not attacking the French fleet, without waiting a length
of time to gain the weather guage, and trusting so long as the
Engl[i]sh fleet did there to an unruly element. Sir, in the actions
in the West-Indies, between the English and French fleets, last
war, where the former were greatly inferior both in number and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
weight of metal, the French were beat off and obliged to fly for it.
So, in the case of the Monmouth, the Dorsetshire, and several other
instances, inferiority in the outset of the contest proved victorious
in the end. I will not, however, dwell upon matters which merely
depend upon opinion, and upon which the best officer in the world
may be mistaken. But, Sir, after the tempest at Rhode-Island, when
the Noble Lord returned to New-York to refit, was not time lost?
the very time that might have been employed in separating D’Estaign
from Boston harbour? I might say, Sir, in the defeat of
D’Estaign; for, after the arrival of some of B[y]r[o]n’s squadron,
the Noble Lord was superior to him.⸺It is a very unpleasant
task to speak out, but I cannot avoid giving my opinion as a seaman,
and as one upon the spot, acquainted with the delays in this business.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, Sir, my opinion, in a very few words is this:
The violent and impolitic measures of the M[i]n[i]stry of this
country first lost America⸺the Br[i]t[i]sh army might have
regained it⸺and our fleet has lost more than one opportunity
of crushing that of France, upon which American resistance chiefly
depended for protection and support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord H[o]we.</div>

<p><i>Lord H[o]we</i> and <i>Mr. R[i]gby</i> now rose; but the house appearing
inclined to give the former an immediate opportunity to reply,
Mr. R[i]gby sat down, and Lord H[o]we, in very modest yet
pointed terms, remarked on the unfairness which, he must say, the
Honourable Gentleman who spoke last, had discovered both in the
design and manner of his speech. That, first, to avoid entering into
the motives and principles of his own conduct, as being more proper
objects for a particular committee of enquiry, and then to launch out
into vague and desultory accusations of any other person, was inconsistent,
and, he was sorry to add, illiberal. That whatever prejudices
those reflections were intended to create against his conduct,
he would not then interrupt the business of the day, and the more
general subjects of the present debate, but trust to the candour of
the house for suspending their opinion, until the whole of his conduct
might be minutely investigated by a committee appointed for
that purpose; which committee, he himself should be the first man
in that house to solicit, nay demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. R[i]gby.</div>

<p><i>Mr. R[i]gby.</i>⸺I should not, Sir, have troubled the house on
this first day, but that I felt it the indispensable duty of private
friendship, to express my feelings on the happy return of our worthy
Commissioner, who has given you, Sir, so full and satisfactory an
account both of his principles and conduct.⸺I shall not trouble
you long, Sir; I rise only for that purpose.⸺I am sure
there is no Gentleman in this house, who more heartily congratulates
the worthy Commissioner on his unembarrassed countenance
and his good looks. He certainly has passed the summer very profitably—the
voyage seems to have improved his stock of spirits—I
think, I never saw him appear to more advantage—I own, however,
I sincerely regret the unpoliteness of his American friends.
After such condescending invitations of himself, it was not very
civil of those Gentlemen to send excuses—If he had been admitted
to their society, I have no manner of doubt of the wonderful effects
his eloquence would have wrought. Even if they had allowed him
a sight of the country, a man of his taste would have brought us
home some curious American memoirs: but, alas! he was not only
disappointed in that wish, but in one of a still gentler kind. I mean,
Sir, a <i>Flirtation Treaty</i>, which he <i>attempted</i>, to negotiate with a
celebrated female politician, the <i>Messalina of Congress</i>. I say attempted,
Sir; for unfortunately even there too his Excellency met
with as cold a reception. Unfortunately! for, had the Lady indulged
him with a <i>hearing</i>, or even a <i>sight</i>, what surer line to lay
the foundation of a more lasting connection? But, in short, Sir,
whether from fate or insufficiency, the affair dropt, and the <i>Flirtation
Treaty</i> fell to the ground⸺ ⸺Sir, I trouble the
house very seldom, and with as few words as possible⸺my opinion
continues to be what it invariably has been, with respect to
America—this country may be deprived of its interests, its dignity,
and its honour; but, as I never can give my assent to a voluntary
surrender of them, I most heartily agree in the support which the
address proposes to afford to his M[ajest]y.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. T. T[o]wns[e]nd.</div>

<p>Mr. <i>T. T[o]wns[e]nd</i> rose, and with great vehemence arraigned
the levity of the Right Honourable Gentleman who spoke
before him; he thought it highly indecent, at this important crisis,
when the very existence of this country is at stake, that any Gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
should endeavour to raise a laugh, and turn the momentous
deliberations of that day into ridicule. Under such circumstances,
in his opinion, jocularity was flagitious, and wit became blasphemy.
He had, himself, sat in three P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nts, and he appealed
to the candour of that house, whether in that length of time he had
once raised a laugh, or on any occasion intentionally distorted the
muscles of any Honourable Member? “No Sir, the true design of
our meeting here, is for far other purposes than those of calling
forth the risibility of Honourable Gentlemen: a risibility at any time
highly improper for this house, but particularly so at this tremendous,
this disgraceful moment.—It is with the highest astonishment
that I now see Gentlemen shifting their places, as if already
tired of public business, or afraid to look into the deplorable and
calamitous situation of this country: nay, so great is their inattention
to their duty in P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt, that, upon my rising, I find
the house almost cleared—where are the Members?—I am afraid—at
dinner! Is this a time for revelling in taverns, when the dignity
of the Imperial Crown of this country is violated, and much
harm done to our merchants?—Is this a time for revelling, when
the glory of Britannia, Sir, I say, is sullied, and when, Sir, the
French are riding on your narrow seas.”⸺He then entered into
a copious detail of the blunders of Administration, with respect to
Falkland’s Islands, the Middlesex Election, Corsica, and the massacre
in St. George’s Fields, Gibraltar, and Mr. Horne’s imprisonment;
together with cursory observations on the illegality of impressing,
the bad policy of Lotteries, the fatal example of the Justitia,
and the tremendous perils to this devoted country from the frequent
exhibition of the Beggar’s Opera.⸺At length, returning a little
closer to the question, he again animadverted on the surprising
inattention of the House: “Yet Sir, (he exclaimed) before I sit
down let me ask Ministers a few questions—I do not expect any
answer from them, yet I will ask them⸺Is Dominica the only
one of our West India Islands now in the possession of France?
Are we to go on for ever with the American war?—Who are our
allies?—Is Omiah to pay us another visit?—Where is Sir Harry
Cl[i]nt[o]n?⸺How is the Czarina affected?—What will
D’Estaign do after Christmas?⸺Where will the Brest fleet be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
next summer?⸺If Ministers will not, and I know they dare
not, answer these questions, then Sir, how, in God’s name, can they
refuse the papers called for by the noble Lord’s Amendment? From
those papers, I pledge myself to the house, the whole of these nefarious
proceedings will be brought to light—discouraged, as I well
might be, from again pledging my person, (having been the constant
and unredeemed pledge of this House, for one thing or another,
for these one and twenty years last past,) I repeat it, Sir,
I will pledge the reversion of myself, that these papers will furnish
us with all necessary and constitutional information.—And, for
these reasons, Sir, the Amendment meets with my most hearty concurrence.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. V[y]n[e]r.</div>

<p>Mr. <i>V[y]n[e]r</i> professed himself to be one of the independant
Country Gentlemen, and took occasion to inform the house, that
five Indiamen arrived in the River Thames about six weeks ago.—He
said he embraced this earliest opportunity to repeat his offer
of fifteen shillings in the pound, if Ministers would but seriously
go on with the war, which, for his part, he now considered
in a new point of view—for, as a great statesman had once
boasted to have conquered, in his time, America in Germany, so
he would hope and believe, that we, in our days, might conquer
France in America.—And here, from regretting the loss of that
great statesman, he fell into a train of melancholy thoughts, which
led him insensibly to a pathetic eulogy on the memory of his dear
departed friend, the well-known Mr. <i>Van</i>.—“A long course of
congenial studies (he exclaimed, with torrents of tears and frequent
sobs) had entwined our hearts in political sympathy—we
had but one idea between us!—Yes, Sir, I repeat it, but one—Well
therefore may I say with the Poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In infancy our hopes and fears</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Were to each other known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And friendship in our riper years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Had twined our hearts in one.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here he broke off, oppressed with a flood of tears, while a confused
noise of <i>encore</i> and <i>order</i> resounded from several parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
house. At length, when the uproar began to subside, and Gentlemen
became collected enough to proceed on business,</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hon. T. L[u]ttr[e]l.</div>

<p><i>Hon. T. L[uttre]l</i> rose, and with great solemnity, addressed
himself to the chair in the following words:⸺Notwithstanding
the general silence, which, I find, it is the fashion for Ministers
of this day not only to hold themselves, but likewise to encourage
in others, on the important subject of maritime affairs, I cannot,
Sir, acquiesce in so culpable a silence, nor content myself with sitting
still, until the close of the debate, to be numbered with the tacit
votes in its disfavour. Sir, the Navy, I have ever considered not
only as the true and constitutional safe-guard of this insular territory,
but as the very spirit and soul of all traffic, the quintessence
of merchandize, and indeed, I may say, the palladium of commerce.
With this view, Sir, my studies have ever tended to the investigation
of the origin of that stupendous piece of mechanism, a ship.⸺Noah,
Sir, was, in my opinion, the first circumnavigator—(I beg
to be understood, I mean no reflection on the memory of Sir Francis
Drake)—he was therefore, Sir, justly entitled to the highest situation
in the naval department of that early period—take him for all
in all, we shall not look upon his like again—though, in truth, there
are traits in his character not totally dissimilar to some leading features
of the noble Earl who is now at the head of that department—But
it is not for me to draw the parallel.</p>

<p>Sir, The Phœnicians</p>

<p class="tb-large">It was a custom also among the Chaldeans and the Nazareens</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p class="tb-large">Recollect, Sir, when news was brought to the Persians</p>

<p class="tb-large">So the Macedonians</p>

<p class="tb-large">In like manner the Lacedemonians, and the Athenians</p>

<p class="tb-large">Thus too the Carthagenians</p>

<p class="tb-large">Here let me call your attention to the Romans and Syracusians</p>

<p class="tb-large">Need I remind you of the northern hive, or trouble you with the
Goths and Vandals?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p class="tb-large">So too, Sir, the Chinese</p>

<p class="tb-large">At length, Mr. Sp[ea]k[e]r, the Danes, Dutch, Swedes, Venetians,
Neapolitans, Spaniards, French, Portuguese, Muscovites,
Turks, Saracens, and others, that I skip over to avoid tediousness</p>

<p class="tb-large">And to bring it home to our feelings, the ancient Britons, hardy
Welch, Milesians, wild Irish, Saxons, Picts, Normans, English, and
<i>Regattaites</i> rush upon our mind, and</p>

<p class="tb-large">From this historical deduction, I cannot but think, Sir, navigation
highly necessary, highly favourable to liberty.</p>

<p>If, Sir, I wanted any additional reason for opposing the address,
it would best arise from the shameful neglect and inattention to
those brave and humane French officers, (particularly the Captain
of the Licorne,) lately on their parole at Alresford, half of whom,
indeed, ministry have cruelly suffered to run away. Besides, Sir,
let us advert to the wretched deficiency in our late naval equipments.⸺I
have it, Sir, from undoubted authority, that the
several ships crews laboured under a total deprivation of Tobacco.
Tobacco! that staple commodity of our once flourishing subjects,
now, alas, our avowed enemies, in Virginia, and the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
colonies.—Sir, not only the quota of Gin was miserably retrenched,
but adultery, so congenial to the <i>Noah</i> of this day, pervaded every
keg in the Royal Navy.—Sir, I myself know it for a fact, that the
speaking trumpet of the Albion was sent out in so wretched a condition,
that, in haling a fishing-boat, (I believe a cod-smack) off
Scilly, the second mate cracked his pipe, and half the crew have
been hoarse ever since—some of your ships, Sir, wanted their complement
of Chaplains:—and in others, I will not say that I know
there were not surgeons, but I will say, I do <i>not</i> know that there
were. Sir, more fatal consequences have arisen from a strange
neglect of vegetables—Potatoes, radically rotten!—Carrots, diabolically
dry!—Turnips, totally tough!—Parsnips, pitifully putrid!⸺Scurvy,
Sir, Scurvy, like the angry Dæmon of Pestilence,
has lighted up everlasting bon-fires in the blotched brows and cicatracious
cheeks of your scarified seamen; so that every crew has
flashed contagion, and reeked like a floating Pest-house, with the
baneful exhalations of disease.—And now, Sir, that I’m on my
legs, a word or two to trowzers—Such is the pitiful œconomy of
Administration, such the paltry treachery of Contractors, that, what
from an original coarseness of yarn, what, from the more pernicious
and slovenly texture of the workmanship, not a trowzer but gaped
with lacerations, whose expanded apertures discovered what⸺the
P[a]rl[ia]m[e]nt[a]ry decorum of this house, forbids me to
reveal. Spurred on by such powerful incentives, I take this earliest
occasion to give notice to the house, that I shall move, on this day
fortnight, for the house to resolve itself into a Committee, in order
to take into consideration the several weighty grievances, the outline
of which I have just now had the honour to give you a rude
sketch.—When, I shall also move you, Sir, that the several Maltsters,
Distillers of Gin, Venders of Tobacco, Traders in Trowzers,
Retailers of Rum, Picklers of Pork, and Purveyors of Potatoes, together
with their several servants, followers, apprentices and retainers,
be ordered to attend this house <i>de die in diem</i>, to answer all
such questions and matters touching the said enquiry, as shall be
put to them by the Committee so to be appointed.—In the mean
time, Sir, I shall give my hearty concurrence to the noble Lord’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Amendment, as promising to afford some degree of preliminary
information, which may tend to illustrate the more important matter
in the Enquiry which I have now proposed to set on foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. P[e]nt[o]n.</div>

<p>Mr. <i>P[e]nt[o]n</i>, in reply, begged pardon for troubling the
house, but hoped they would indulge him in a few words, as he
felt himself particularly called on to answer some reflections which
the Honourable Gentleman, who had spoke last, had thought
proper to throw out against that board where he had the honour to
sit.—He said, that, at the time of the fitting out of Mr. K[e]pp[e]l’s
fleet, he had made it his business to be very much at Portsmouth,
where, though it was a task exceedingly repugnant to his
private feelings and taste, he had, however, considered it as an official
service incumbent on one in his department, to personally experiment
the several provisions and stores prepared for that equipment.
That, impelled by such motives, he had, on several occasions,
drank the small beer, not unfrequently tasted the gin, and sometimes
smoak’d, nay chewed the tobacco; that, in his humble opinion,
they were all super-excellent in their several kinds. And, as to
the imputed delinquency relative to potatoes, he could assure the
house, he had bought up several tuns of the same species, for the
consumption of his own family—nay, he would go further, he
would venture to acquaint that house, that with some of those
very identical potatoes, he had lately had the happiness and honour
to regale a certain Great Personage, then his guest; a personage
indeed of too high a rank to have his name even alluded to, though
on so weighty, and so important a business.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. B[urke].</div>

<p><i>Mr. B[u]rke</i>⸺I must confess, Sir, notwithstanding my
long and melancholy experience of the present administration, I
cannot hear, without astonishment, the language held forth by the
speech, and echoed in this day’s debate. This session, Sir, at a
period big with horror, pregnant with ruin to this country, is
ushered in with the song of triumph; and parliament are bid to
rejoice at a time when nothing but the language of despair is to be
heard throughout the nation. Surely, Sir, the hour is at last arrived,
when humility and moderation ought to take place of pride and
confidence; when, instead of launching further into a sea of troubles,
we might be content to try what little can be saved from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
wreck of national honour and prosperity. Ministers might at length
condescend to tell us, what means are left to avert the gathering
ruin; how we are to tread back the mazes of error and folly,
through which we have been led; and where are the resources from
which one gleam of hope might dawn upon us, in the hour of danger
and despair—But, deaf to the solemn call of occasion and
necessity, they rejoice in the absence of thought, in the contempt
of foresight. Like the wretch who seeks in stupefaction a momentary
relief from sorrow, they sink from a voluntary intoxication into a
torpid insensibility. The illusion, indeed, is not to be confined within
the narrow limits of their own minds; its baneful influence must
be circulated through every corner of the nation; and, by a shameful
perversion, that anxiety for the public welfare, which, in times
like these, is, in my opinion, the highest of public virtues, must be
amused with the pageantry of domestic warfare, or lulled by the
opiate of our American Gazettes. I own, Sir, even on principles of
criticism, I cannot but consider the stile of these Ministerial annals,
as no very favourable criterion of the present times. In happier days,
their characteristic was plain conciseness. Victories were then too
rapid, too numerous, to admit of a dilated relation.—Success is
seldom tedious, but I am afraid our highest atchievements have
amounted to no more than the inroads of savages, or the depredations
of pyrates. Upon my word, Sir, though we may censure our
Officers, our Ministers at least shew some generalship; if they cannot
deceive the enemy, they are prompt enough to mislead their
countrymen; though they discover but little skill in the arrangement
of armies, they have an admirable talent in marshalling Gazettes.
They have given celebrity to sheep-stealing, and blazoned,
in all the pompous prolixity of ostentatious phraseology, the important
depredations at—<i>Martha’s</i> Island—Certainly, Sir, the gallant
Commander of that expedition may vie in pastoral atchievements
with Ajax, with Jason, or at least Don Quixote; and, if
he does not obtain a triumph, he is clearly entitled to an <i>ovation</i>.
Not, Sir, that I mean to cast any reflection on those Officers and
Soldiers to whose lot these ridiculous services have fallen—they,
no doubt, have effected every thing that the bravery of the British
troops in such a situation could accomplish; but the Hand of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Nature, Sir, has thrown in their way obstacles which it was not
in the most obstinate valour, in the most consummate wisdom to
surmount. It is a want of confidence in the directors of this war
that has chilled every vein, and slackened every sinew of military
enterprize. Besides, Sir, if I may be permitted to indulge a little
superstition, there is a certain fatality attending the measures of
Administration: through all their bungling operations of war,
through all their wretched plans of peace, the evil Genius, Sir, of
this country, seems to haunt their footsteps. He it is that has suffered
them to wander on, undismayed by danger, unabashed by
reproaches, from one absurdity to another, ’till our blunders and our
follies have at length reared that stupendous fabric of American
Empire that now engrosses the attention, and claims the wonder
of mankind. Allow me, Sir, to pause for a moment, while I contemplate
this phœnomenon of modern ages, this new constellation
in the western hemisphere; a mighty and extensive empire, not
rising by slow degrees and from small beginnings, but bursting forth
at once into full vigour and maturity; not cherished in the soft lap
of peace and commerce, but shaking off in its outset the long established
dominion of a powerful master, and thriving in the midst of
carnage and desolation. “Ab ipso ducit opes animumq. bello.” If
we view them in another light, as completely enthroned in sovereignty,
as receiving embassies from distant potentates, as forming
leagues with the princes and states of Europe, we shall find more
abundant matter for self-humiliation—I could wish to shut my
eyes on the scene that follows: The parent baffled and depressed,
imploring pardon of her injured and alienated children, yielding to
their successful resistance, what she had denied to their prayers and
petitions, and offering every concession short of a total emancipation;
but scorned and rejected in her turn, not (as she had rejected
them) with rudeness and insolence, but with firmness and with
dignity; and convinced, at length, that the day of conciliation is
past, and that the groundwork of peace can only be laid on the
broad basis of equality and independance.</p>

<p>Is this the unconditional submission the noble Lord in the American
department so prodigally announced? This is indeed unconditional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
submission, but unconditional submission from Great Britain
to America.</p>

<p>Gentlemen may remember how often my voice has preached
peace within these walls; how often it has warned administration
to healing measures, while the wounds of America might yet have
been closed. I will still repeat it, ’till the echo of this house shall be
conscious of no other sound; Peace, Peace, Peace, is still my object.</p>

<p>It is now high time, Sir, that Gentlemen should awaken to a
sense of our danger, that Parliament should discard those wretched
schemes of short-sighted policy, which cannot, in our present situation,
afford even a temporary refuge. As yet, we experience only
the beginnings of our sorrows; but the storms of adversity are
gathering fast around us, and the vessel is still trusted to the direction
of Pilots, whose ignorance and obstinacy has been manifest to
all the world.⸺What thanks, Sir, to the vigilance of our Rulers,
that we are not already sunk beyond the possibility of redemption?
What thanks to them, that the flower of our army and navy,
and with them all the hopes of Britain had not withered before the
power of a lately dejected but now triumphant enemy? Is it owing
to their care that the rich produce of the Western Isles has not
flowed into every harbour of France?</p>

<p>No, Sir, it is the hand of Providence that wards off for a while
the ruin of this declining empire. It is Providence alone that has
preserved our gallant Admirals in America, by an almost miraculous
interposition.—It is due to Providence alone, that the heart-strings
of our commerce are not cut asunder by the sword of our
adversaries.</p>

<p>I own, Sir, I cannot join in an implicit approbation of such ministers:
I must be a little better acquainted with their merits before
I can place an unlimited confidence in their wisdom and discretion;
that discretion which has led us into a labyrinth of difficulties; that
wisdom that cannot find a clue for our deliverance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. D[u]nn[in]g.</div>

<p>Mr <i>D[u]nn[i]ng</i> said a few words, which, from the learned
gentleman’s being particularly hoarse and uncommonly inarticulate,
owing (as has been suggested) to a violent cold, and a multiplicity
of business in Westminster-hall, we could not collect with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
the accuracy that we wish to observe on every occasion. His language
was neat and pointed, though somewhat tinctured with professional
pedantry: his arguments seemed ingenious, though perhaps
too refined for the comprehension of his auditors. He had much
antithesis, much verbal gingle, and many whimsical climaxes. He
talked of the competency or incompetency of the House to the discussion
of the present question; of the materiality or immateriality
of the proposed amendment; of the responsibility or irresponsibility
of Ministers. He said, he neither asked, nor knew, nor cared to
what the present question might ultimately tend; but of this he was
confident, that it’s propriety was clearly evinced, and it’s necessity
irrefragably proved by that opposition which purported to baffle it.—Upon
the whole, his harrangue seemed to be a medley of legal
quibble and quaint humour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. S[olicito]r G[enera]l.</div>

<p>Mr. <i>S[o]ll[i]c[i]t[o]r-G[e]n[e]r[a]l</i>, <span class="smcap">Contra</span>, began with
<i>declaring</i>, that when he <i>tuk</i> his present office, he <i>understud</i> it to be
a <i>General Retainer</i>, to <i>shew cause</i> in behalf of Administration:
That, therefore, he hoped to be favoured with a few words by way
of <i>replication</i> to his learned friend: That he might in this case have
insisted on <i>want of notice</i>, but, for the sake of candour in practice,
he would waive that objection; for, that he had no doubt, on the
merits, but that <i>judgment wud be given</i> in his favour: <i>Protesting</i>,
that the speech was <i>warranted</i> by <i>precedent</i>, and had <i>the highest
authority</i> in it’s support: <i>Protesting</i> also, that no <i>gud</i> objection <i>cud</i>
be made to the address, as it strictly pursued the very words of the
speech. He <i>justified, under an immemorial custom</i>, that Administration
<i>have been accustomed to have, and still of right ought to have</i>,
certain echoes in this House, called <i>Addresses</i>.—He admitted, that
<i>true it was</i>, there had been some <i>errors in our proceedings</i> with respect
to America; but he was informed, and believed, that Sir Henry
Clinton intended to have a <i>new trial</i>. As to the cause of Great Britain
<i>versus</i> France, he had been given to understand and be informed,
that the place in which the <i>trespass</i> was supposed to have been committed,
was, <span class="smcap">parcel</span> of the Island of Dominica, <i>in parts beyond the
seas</i>; which place said French, with force of arms, to wit, with ships
of divers guns, drums, trumpets, bayonets, hand grenades, and
cartridge boxes, had broken and entered, <i>doing nevertheless as little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
damage on that occasion as they possibly cud</i>: but that he was
clearly of opinion, that if the troops of said France should <i>traverse</i>
the Channel, and lay <i>a Venue</i> in Kent or Sussex, <i>issue might be
joined</i> by the militia at Cox-Heath; and, in that case, <i>afterwairds</i>,
if verdict <i>shud</i> be given in our favour, the adverse party would sustain
heavy and exemplary <i>damages</i>.—He concluded with <i>averring</i>,
that he approved of the address in it’s present form; and that he
should <i>demur</i> to the amendment moved by the Noble <i>Lud</i>, as <i>multifarious,
uncertain, insufficient, and informal</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr F[o]x.</div>

<p>Mr <i>F[o]x</i> now rose; and, with that extent of information, refined
perspicuity, and vehemence of eloquence, by which he so invariably
commands the attention and admiration of the House,
entered at large into the subject of debate.</p>

<p>To do justice to the force of his reasoning, or elegance of his
stile, is totally beyond the utmost efforts of the editor.—All that
he can attempt is, to give an imperfect sketch of an inimitable original.⸺He
began with lamenting the accomplishment of that
ruin, which, from time to time, he had too justly predicted. He
confessed, that little merit could be ascribed to those prophecies;
which, however chimerical and visionary ministers had affected to
consider them, were, in fact, no more than plain deductions of what
must necessarily ensue from their own measures. He proceeded to
recapitulate the conduct of Administration since the prorogation of
Parliament; particularly observing on the impolitic removal of the
troops from Philadelphia at the moment, when, if ever, their continuance
<i>there</i> might have effected some good purpose. The concealment
of that intended evacuation, even from the Commissioners
themselves, was a part (he said) of that system of duplicity and
deception which pervaded the whole of ministerial conduct. Possibly,
indeed, Ministers were aware, that gentlemen of high character
and esteem would not have become the executive tools of a
plan so wretchedly concerted. The Commissioners therefore were
not suffered to participate in counsels, which, if they had known,
they must have despised. Nor was folly more conspicuous in the
origin than in the prosecution of this paltry disingenuous plan. Sir
Henry Clinton, to whose courage and conduct every praise is due,
was ordered to return to New-York. Encumbered with baggage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
and pursued by an army superior in numbers, he made his way thro’
the almost impervious forests of that country; and, by almost a
miraculous effort, not only secured his retreat, but in the Jerseys
had the good fortune to resist the enemy with some success—a success
however, which, without disparaging the British troops, must
in great part be attributed to General Lee; who, in consequence of
his misconduct in that affair, was immediately put in arrest, and
afterwards suspended for the space of a year.</p>

<p>He went on with indicating the circumstance of a fleet of Victuallers
having been sent to Philadelphia, after the army, which was to
be supplied by that fleet, had been ordered to evacuate Philadelphia.—That
fleet, he said, had narrowly escaped being taken in
the Delaware; and, thence, he argued Ministers were as culpable,
as if, in consequence of the capture of that fleet, the army, then
arrived at New-York, had famished for want of those provisions,
on which their future subsistance was wholly dependant.</p>

<p>He said, he was yet to learn what plan Administration could pretend
to alledge they had followed, or meant to follow, in America.
Upon what grounds could they attempt to prosecute an <i>offensive</i>
war? Or, taking the alternative, how can they presume to say they
have acted on the <i>defensive</i>?⸺As to the first, they have thirty
thousand men to conquer the continent of America: admitting then
the superiority of their army and their navy, still he contended that
superiority had been, and ever must be ineffectual and useless; because,
as long as the English army and navy co-operate, the Americans
will never have the unnecessary temerity to give up the advantage
of situation, or expose their cause to the hazard of one
decisive engagement. The last campaign was the clearest proof of
that position; and, now, though our fleet was superior to the French,
yet D’Estaign is safe at Boston.—It was, on that principle, he
doubted not, the gallant and experienced Commanders of the last
campaign had formed their conduct: It was their policy, and, in his
opinion, the best policy, to keep a collected force, and to avoid any
inferior exertions, that might require a separation, or weaken that
superiority, which, in case of a decisive action, they rightly judged
could alone have been fatal to American resistance.—It remained
for General Clinton to pursue a contrary policy.—Yet, though (he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
declared) no man in that house entertained a higher respect for
the personal and professional merit of that able Commander, (who
from his particular talent for military enterprise, and his education
under the Prince of Brunswick, was best calculated for effecting
such a plan) yet, from the minutest investigation of the late Gazettes,
he could not collect any very auspicious presage of his military
career. If indeed, from his observation, of what had already
happened, he might hazard an opinion of what may happen, we
had no reason to rejoice at the revival of that plan of separation,
which had proved so fatal in the Northern expedition. He was sorry
he had mentioned that expedition—It led him to a subject he wished
to avoid.—He had been accused of an asperity of reflexion on the
conduct of the noble Lord who planned that expedition. He would
strive, in future, to overcome his indignation, by indulging his contempt
for the Adviser of it.—Yet, thus much he would say; though
unhappy for this country, it was happy for our troops, happy for
our officers, to be directed and controlled by a Minister, to whose
wisdom not even Envy could ascribe one particle of their success,
in whose imbecillity even Justice would afford them an asylum from
every disgrace.</p>

<p>Having thus stated the impracticability of an offensive war in
America, either on the former plan of united force, or on the present
separate efforts, he recurred to the other part of his argument,
whether Administration could pretend to alledge their having
adopted the alternative, and formed even a defensive plan for America
and the West-Indies?⸺If they dared to assume that merit,
how could they expect the House to attend, with any degree of
patience, to such a mockery of all truth? On any rational plan of
mere defence, would they not have left a force at New-York,
Rhode-Island, and Halifax, fully able to prevent any attack in that
quarter; at the same time, detaching a sufficient force to protect
the West-India Islands?—Upon such a plan, would not any spirited
Minister have grafted some degree of activity and enterprise?
Would He not have attacked Martinique, Guadaloupe, or St. Domingo?
Such conduct would have struck terror to France, we
should have been enriched by new acquisitions, or, at least, have
prevented the disgrace of our own losses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>But, admitting that this defensive plan may have been but recently
adopted, how are Administration to regain the time they have
lost, or what resources of finance are still unexhausted to prosecute
even this plan? Are all the Country Gentlemen equally disposed to
devote fifteen shillings in the pound to carry on this defensive war?
Are they all equally delighted with the great and growing ruin of
an accumulating debt and a decreasing revenue? Or do they rest
their hopes on the wealth of our East-India trade? Do they know
that, there too, the French are undermining the foundation of our
commerce? Or is it studiously concealed from them, that the French
ministry have sent Monsieur Vaugelin to Canton, in the quality
of their Consul at the Chinese Court?⸺He had heard much
of a sudden increase of national wealth by our late captures, but, at
best, the prizes of privateers are a partial benefit; they can enrich
but a few individuals; they afford no diminution of the general
burthens of a whole people. In the present instance, the truth was
these boasted prizes were, in fact, public losses; the French having
had the art to insure their most valuable ships, particularly the Indiamen,
by English policies—besides that, several of the richest captures
were actually freighted with consignments to English merchants.</p>

<p>But, supposing this extraordinary spirit of bounty should become
general among the Country Gentlemen, and that, to support a war
which had totally lost the original object of revenue, for which they
had been tempted to engage in it; supposing they were all well
inclined to a land-tax of fifteen shillings in the pound, and determined
to overflow the Exchequer with an extraordinary redundance
of profusion, yet would they be particularly happy that all that
wealth should be portioned out to subsidise Hanover, Hesse-Cassel,
Hanau, Waldeck, Brandebourg-Anspach, and all the mercenaries
of Germany? Or that it should wholly be devoted to satiate the
monopolising avarice of a Russian alliance? You have no force at
home—you are almost defenseless.⸺</p>

<div class="sidenote">Col. T[u]ffn[e]ll.</div>

<p>(Here he was called to order by Colonel Tuffnell for speaking
of the <i>defenceless</i> state of this country.) Col. <i>T[u]ffn[e]ll</i> said,
the word <i>defenceless</i> was, to the last degree, improper and disorderly;
for that he himself had the command at Dover Castle, opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Calais, where, though the country all about it was rather flat,
he would not wish such a word as <i>defenceless</i> to be sent from
that house to Paris, by any friend of Dr. Franklin’s. And, as he
was on his legs, he must say, that word <i>defenceless</i> was doubly
wrong, from the late state of the camps; where, in spite of French
spies, there had been the utmost discipline, unanimity, peace, and
quietness; except, indeed, some desertions, much nakedness, frequent
floggings, and several duels.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>F[o]x</i> then proceeded, without any remark on this interruption;
and observed, that every petty Landgrave and Margrave
had already been exhausted; they had no more Chasseurs,
no more mercenary boors, to fight, or rather not to fight, our
battles. Russia is frozen up for some months; and, not improbably,
the courts of Berlin and Vienna would sufficiently engage
her in their Bavarian contest; or, at least, not make it adviseable
for her to lessen the internal defence of a country surrounded with
such powerful armies. As to the Fleet, how could it be recruited
with sailors or marines? Though even the spirit of adventure
could instantly man every Privateer that had been fitted out, yet
the noble Lord at the head of the Admiralty had pretended to
palliate his own incapacity and criminal neglect, by alledging it
was almost impossible, even with an extraordinary bounty, and
the utmost rigour of an Impress and an Embargo, to man the
Royal Fleet—the fact was, the minds of the people were obstinately
bent against this American war; nay, even against a
French war, when France became the protector of America.</p>

<p>With such Ministers, such principles, such plans, such internal
resources, such prospects of alliance; Gentlemen were now called
on to echo the Speech, to panegyrize an Administration too despicable
for satire, to plunge this devoted country in aggravated
ruin, and, with a remorseless dispair, to <i>desolate</i> what they had
found impossible to <i>subdue</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord N[o]rth.</div>

<p>L[o]rd <i>N[o]rth</i>.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Mr. Sp[eake]r, at the same time that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
agree with many Gentlemen who have spoken in the course of
this day’s debate, that the present is a very serious moment of
deliberation, I can by no means join with them in thinking our
situation is desperate, though, I confess, it is distressing.</p>

<p>Sir, in all cases of distress or difficulty there is some relief to
be found in comparison. Gentlemen who hear me, will admit
that this country, in former wars, has been acquainted with unfortunate
events. The loss of some of our possessions, and the
failure of enterprizes, marked the onset of last war. Commanders
were unsuccessful, perhaps criminal;—I do not mean to draw a
complete analogy between that period and the present—I only
mean to observe, that there has been no difficulty in modern
times, from which this Country has not been able to extricate itself,
when rouzed by a sense of its wrongs, and determined to
vindicate its justice, its dignity, and its honour.⸺In saying this,
I shall be told by Gentlemen that we were indebted to a great
Character in the midst of our misfortunes during the last war,
and that, by his vigour and enterprizing genius, this Country was
extricated from her embarrassing situation. I will join heartily in
paying that tribute of truth to his memory⸺Would to God
that such a man were alive at this moment, to step forward with the
full exertion of the same zeal, and the same talents. I would yield
to none as a second in the work, though I confess my inability
to be employed as a first.</p>

<p>Sir, the Honourable Gentleman who spoke last, has gone over
such a variety of ground, and has given so large a history of the
wickedness of Ministers during the American war, that the asperity
with which he has delivered it, would be a sufficient reason
for my silence, did I not think it necessary, from a duty I owe
to this house and to my country, to give some answers to assertions
which have fallen from him.</p>

<p>Sir,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to the first complaint, which the Honourable Gentleman
makes, of the Minister’s concealment from the Commissioners of
the removal of the troops from Philadelphia, I shall only answer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
that the importance of that proceeding required the nicest secrecy,
and (though I do not mean to suggest the least idea disadvantageous
to the confidence of the Commissioners) it is perhaps owing
to the secret decision upon that matter, that the removal of the
fleet and army from the Delaware was so timely, and so effectually
executed. And I will add, that (whatever opinions may have
been conceived either by the Commissioners or any other persons)
the events, which have since happened, amply justify the wisdom
of the measure.⸺With respect to the bad policy, as some Gentlemen
have called it, of opening a negotiation with a retreating
army, will any one tell me, that, had your army and navy been
blocked up by Mons. D’Estaign’s fleet, with the prospect of all
of the latter being utterly destroyed in the Delaware, the Congress
would have been more inclined to treat with your Commissioners,
than when all were safe at New-York?—Were they inclined
to negotiate with Lord H[o]we and Sir William H[o]we,
(who had sufficient powers) at Philadelphia, after the receipt of
the bills, and before the arrival of the new Commissioners?⸺No,
Sir—no appearances of reconciliation on the part of
the Congress were shewn at that time:—their minds, worked
up by their leaders to a spirit of enthusiasm, indulged the expectation
of destruction to our fleet, at least, from the powers of
France.—I am free to confess, Sir, that when I heard Mons.
D’Estaign had arrived in America previous to Admiral Byron,
(whose fleet had been so unfortunately dispersed) I had little
hopes from the temper and inclinations of the Congress, that they
would be induced to treat; until some blow had been struck, and
that on our part, of a successful nature.—My confidence was, and
still is, Sir, in the people there at large—groaning under the worst
of all tyrannies, involved in a ruinous, and, I maintain, an unsuccessful
war; and driven by their corrupted leaders into a most
unnatural connection with France; I say, Sir, if one spark of
British sense and honour yet remains, if one drop of blood of this
country still flows in the veins of the Americans, they will avail
themselves of our liberality, and return to their former happy and
enviable subordination to this country.</p>

<p>With respect to the Fleet of Victuallers, which, the Honourable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Gentleman observed, had a narrow escape from the Delaware,
it was supposed they had sailed from Corke, some time before
the orders were sent from hence for the evacuation of Philadelphia;
and it is very lucky they did not sail for New-York; for,
if they had, they would have met with Monsieur D’Estaign there.</p>

<p>It has been urged by the Honourable Gentleman, that the
American war can be no longer made offensive; and therefore,
if a defensive one has been adopted, why not leave a sufficient
number of troops for the defence of New-York, Rhode-Island,
Halifax, and the Floridas? and strike some blow at the French
Settlements in the West-Indies.—Gentlemen will recollect the little
time that has elapsed since the evacuation of Philadelphia, the
attack and defence of Rhode-Island, and the transactions between
Lord Howe’s and D’Estaign’s Fleet, and they will see how difficult
it was to be at a great many places at the same time.—With respect
to Dominica, Sir, the loss of it is certainly a misfortune, but, I
trust, only a temporary one. There can be no blame laid upon the
Ministers for that event, because, in the very beginning of the war
with France, ships were sent sufficient to make at least a superior
force to the French in the West-Indies. I am aware of the force of
the argument that will be made use of upon this occasion—Gentlemen
will say, You have so many places and possessions to guard,
that many of them must be vulnerable; and therefore it is impossible
to go on in a war with France and America at the same time,
with any reasonable expectations of success.—This argument will
lead me to enter a little into what I conceive to be our actual situation
at home and abroad.—With respect to this country, Sir, it is
protected by a fleet superior to the French.—It contains, to the honour
of those who have sacrificed domestic ease to public spirit, a very
fine army, including the regulars, of 50,000 men.—Your ships of
trade and merchandise have arrived safe and unmolested; whilst
the Privateers and Letters of Marque have made considerable
havock upon the property of our enemies.⸺And here I must
remark upon two observations which have fallen from the Honourable
Gentleman who spoke last.—The first, with respect to the
number of sailors who have entered on board these ships at a
time when there was so much difficulty in manning the fleet, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
which is a charge of ignorance in obtaining them upon the Admiralty.—Sir,
the bounty which has been given to seamen by individuals,
to enter on board Privateers and Letters of Marque,
has been enormous—I have been told 10 l.—15 l.—and 20 l.
a-man.—This, with the expectation of the larger share of prize-money
received by lesser vessels, has been a sufficient inducement
to men to enter on board those ships.⸺Upon the other observation,
that the prizes we have taken consist chiefly of British
property, and are insured here—I shall only remark, that the
Merchant here who employs French shipping and French navigation,
in preference to the British, ought to suffer.—But, Sir, with
respect to insurance, let us see which of the two countries suffers
most on that head.—The insurance upon French ships homeward
bound has been very high.—Upon the French Indiamen, I have
heard, so high as 75 l. per cent.—Then, Sir, this being the case, if
the Frenchman arrives safe in France, the Englishman gets 75 l.
per cent.—If he is taken, he loses but 25 l. per cent. whilst his
neighbour shares the prize entirely.—Surely, therefore, Sir, this
country has certainly much the best of the bargain.—This, however,
Sir, great as these advantages are, is no reason nor no inducement
with me for continuing the war.—I am obliged to recur so often
to what has been said, that I beg pardon for deviating from the
chief object, at least of my consideration—that of our actual situation
at home and abroad.—I have already said, Sir, that we are
sufficiently defended by our navy and army at home.—We have
certainly a greater superiority of both in North America—of ships
in the West-Indies—superior in the East-Indies, and shall be
more so when the ships now ready to proceed thither, and with
troops, are arrived there.—Sir, there is wealth, I trust there is
likewise spirit enough in this country, to support us even in a more
embarrassing situation than the present. And, though Gentlemen
may have wished to impeach the security of this country, I will
fairly tell them, that, such is the confidence, even in the hour of
her distress, foreigners of all nations have given, and do give, the
preference to our funds;—the falling of which, immediately after
the opening of the last budget, is to be imputed entirely to the jobbing
of a good purchase at a low bargain, and not to a want of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
confidence in the nation. I could deduce many reasons to justify
me in this opinion; and I could call upon the Dutch, as the best
politicians, in support of it.—Nor, Sir, will I admit the prospect
of ruin to be before us, until I see that the justice of our cause has
left us, and that there no longer exists that zeal and bravery which
have distinguished the people of Great Britain, as superior to the
rest of the world⸺Sir, a great deal has been said by Gentlemen
(who have in my idea gone over, unnecessarily at this time,
the whole of the American war) with respect to the conduct of it.⸺I
believe, even the most inveterate enemies Ministers may
have, will allow that there was transported to a greater distance,
than ever was known before, the finest army; that you fed and
maintained it at that distance; and that, from its excellence and
its superiority, you had a right to expect the most happy advantages.
So far the business, as it concerned Ministry, was well
transacted. But, Sir, then comes the question—were the plans
and the directions to execute them wise and practicable?⸺I
cannot but say, Sir, for my own part, and, as far as my Judgment
went, they were so⸺I do not mean to suggest any thing invidious
towards the Officers to whom commands and responsibility
were delegated⸺I am not one of those who easily condemn,
certainly never will, before I have just grounds for doing so⸺If
our Army and Navy have not done in every part of the world
what was expected of them—Parliament can enquire, can approve,
or censure⸺This however appears to me but a secondary subject
for our consideration.</p>

<p>Sir, much has been said with respect to the Union of France
and America, and the probability there is that Spain will soon be
a party in it. I will not rob many honourable Gentlemen of the
gift of prophecy, of what Spain will do in this conjuncture; but,
Sir, surely her interest and her policy should be to resist the Independance
of America—She will never, by protecting rebellion
in our colonies, hold out encouragement to her own to follow
their example. It is idle, Sir, to indulge the idea of the Spanish
settlements in South America trading with the North Americans,
by purchasing, with Spanish Bullion, North American commodities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
The Court of Spain is much too wise, I think, to adopt such
a measure. What, Sir, might be the consequence? An intercourse
and trade between the extremes of that great quarter of the globe
might at last be united by a centre, and establish the greatest
dominion in the World. For, time may produce daring and flagitious
characters in that continent also, whose object it may be to
destroy the sovereignty of Spain over her Colonists—Neither can
I agree with Gentlemen in thinking, that the union of America
and France can be lasting. I might as well suppose that different
religions, Liberty and slavery, in short, that contrarieties can form
a system, as admit that unity and harmony can ever last between
France and America—Neither of the countries expect it—The one
supports, and the other receives, merely for the temporary purpose
of distressing Great Britain⸺France can have no thoughts of
establishing herself in the Heart of America. And America will
only avail herself of the assistance of France, until she is at peace
with this Country.</p>

<p>In the mean time, however, our exertions must be of a powerful
nature to resist this unnatural alliance—And here, Sir, let me
return to the consideration of what is proper to be done in consequence
of his M[ajes]ty’s speech.</p>

<p>Sir, in giving my entire approbation of what has been proposed
by the Honourable Gentleman in the motion for the Address,
I trust I shall be forgiven, if I submit to the House the
necessity there is at this time of vigour and firmness in all our
proceedings, in order to give a spirit to national exertion. And,
whilst we regret that even our unanimity and liberal offers have
not been productive of peaceable accommodation with America, I
trust that her ingratitude may yet meet with the recompence
such a conduct has deserved: in holding out this doctrine, I mean
not to forget that America is still the offspring of Great Britain:
that when she returns to her duty, she will be received with open
arms, and all her faults be buried in oblivion.</p>

<p>In a word, Sir, the period is arrived, when it is no longer a
question who is to be Minister, who are to compose a party, or
who have been to blame. Such discussions will not probably obtain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
conviction on either side—The day has passed for reflexions
on those who have been alledged to have given confidence to
Insurgency, or on those who have been said to have provoked it.
The object of your consideration is now⸺the salvation of your
Country.</p>

<p>For myself, Sir, I shall no longer desire to remain in my own
situation, than his Majesty, and this House, think I can be useful
in it. If any one Man will take it from me, He will relieve me
from the most anxious tasks that any Minister probably ever experienced:
But, till then, Sir, I look to the support of this house,
and to that of all good Men in defending and maintaining the
glory and honour of Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Col. B[a]rré.</div>

<p>Col. <i>B[a]rré</i> began with recounting his predictions.—I foretold
in the outset of the American contest, that your obstinacy would
establish independance of the colonies. My first prophecy was, that
France would join them—was I wrong?—I will boldly hazard one
prediction more—I say, Spain sooner or later will join both⸺such
are the allies of America.—Who are your’s? The Onandagas, the
Tuscaroras, and the Choctaws! These are your copper coloured
allies, that fix a stain on the name of Britain; and disgrace this
country even in victory, as well as defeat—I knew of these alliances,
and their barbarities, so early as the 8th of June last. I have a letter
from a friend of mine at Poughkeepsie, of that date;—the Indians,
headed by Col. B[u]tl[e]r, began their rapine in <i>Cherry Valley</i>;
parties of <i>Indians and Tories</i> (so my friend couples those blood-hounds
of desolation) butchered the innocent inhabitants of <i>Sacandago</i>,
and spread ruin and carnage through <i>Minisink</i>—I am sure,
Col. B[u]tl[e]r, (who is indeed as gallant and amiable an Officer
as ever I knew, and I know him well) never would have embrued
his hands in innocent blood, but that he knew he must sacrifice
his feelings to the speculative, I do not say practical, violence, of
the American Secretary. Gen. C[a]rlt[o]n lost the Noble Lord’s
favour by his abhorrence of the tomahawk and the scalping knife:—have
not we tried those satanic instruments of death too long?
Is the whole of Miss <i>Macreas</i> race to be sacrificed? Not one innocent
babe left unbutchered to lisp out the tale of that devoted,
that unhappy family? Of whom are we now to enquire for any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
official documents of your war? I see no Secretary of War in this
house? Does the American Secretary monopolize and consolidate
all warlike business? I hope not.⸺</p>

<p>Sir, I beg pardon for the heat which I find rising within me—but
the inexorable hour of vengeance is not far distant; the heavy
load of black and bloody guilt will sink you all.—The time will
come when the thunder of the cannon will be heard at your
walls. Examples will be made. The Tower and the Block must
expiate the crimes of Ministers. The voice of truth will be heard.
The Rubicon is passed.⸺Sir, what is the comparative
state of the revenues of France, and of this country? Mons.
Neckar, a very able and a very amiable man, has, I understand,
found taxes, and not oppressive ones, for two years;—is that a
fact?—The revenue of this country is diminished—it has been
gradually so during this detestable war—will Ministers deny it?
Good God, Sir, what a state are we in? Dominica lost!—Sir,
Monsieur Bouillé was once my particular friend—Sir, he is returned
to France for fresh powers and orders—look to your West-India
settlements, callous as we are, we cannot bear the loss of
them.</p>

<p>Sir, I am astonished at the blind credulity of Ministry—can
they be so very simple as to trust to vague compliments against
those decisive words of the Pacte de Famille, the Family Compact,
“Qui attaque une couronne attaque l’autre;” (I translate
for the country Gentlemen) whoever attacks one crown attacks
the other.⸺I know Count Almodovar—I was introduced to
him by my old friend, Don Francisco Buccarelli:—I never shall
forget dining with him at a kind of Table d’Hotes, in a tavern
opposite the Escurial;—as chance would have it, many more illustrious
characters dined with us that day; there was the Count,
his wife’s cousin, and myself, on one side of the table;—Count
Cobentzel, and Baron Reidesdel (who were then on their travels)
and Duke de Chartres (who had just come from Paris) sat opposite
to us—Monsieur de Sartine (who came in the Duke’s vis
a vis) was at the foot of the table; and we put Buccarelli in the
chair⸺we had an excellent dinner—the wine was good—and
we toasted the Madrid beauties in bumpers of Packeretti—however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
I was not so far gone but I can very well remember
what Almodovar whispered in my ear, while <i>Cobentzel and
Reidsdale</i> were drinking Maxamilian Joseph of Bavaria’s health.
Colonel (says he) <i>Il alte se volto Estremadura che molto</i>—I
won’t translate it. I feel the respect due to Ambassadors.—But,
will Ministry answer a plain question? I put it roundly, because
I ask for a positive answer—Is there no treaty now on the tapis
to cede Gibraltar, or Port Mahon?—I say, the neutrality of Spain
is to be trucked for by the dismembring this country of its best possessions.—Here
he proceeded to read variety of Gazettes, American
News-papers, two or three Treaties, letters from gallant Officers
in all parts of the world; accounts of Cl[i]nt[o]n’s retreat;
transactions of Lord H[o]we, and Mons. D’Estaign; Alderman
Oliver’s letter—affair at Rhode Island, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. He went also
into a string of similar surmises, recognized various intimates in
Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and interspersed the whole
with a multiplicity of anecdotes, proverbs, quotations, menaces
and bon mots—concluding, that having then read to the house
all the various papers he himself could collect, he found it necessary
to give his vote for the Amendment, as the only way to get
at more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr H. St[anle]y.</div>

<p>Mr. H. <i>St[anle]y</i> observed, that many Gentlemen had deviated
from the business immediately before the house, which, in
his opinion, was merely this: Whether this house will or will not
support his M[ajest]y, and the executive powers of government,
in the endeavours to recal the Americans to obedience, and to punish
the natural enemies of this country?<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> That his own opinion
was determined by a conviction of the necessity, in this hour of
difficulty and distress, for exertion and firmness. Much has been
said of the wealth and resources of France in comparison of those
of England. I can only say, Sir, from all the observations I have
been able to make, that France is, with respect to its finances, certainly
an impoverished country. It has not yet recovered the impression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
made by the last war; and, whatever Gentlemen may
think, neither Mons. Neckar (whom I very much respect) nor
any other person, will be able, at least for a great length of time,
to overturn the old mode of attainment of French money; I
mean, Sir, by the vehicle of the <i>Fermeurs Generaux</i>. It must be a
minister of great courage indeed, and a King of Terrors, that will
new model the French finances; new taxes may be imposed, but
I much doubt of the collection of them. When a good contract has
been long in possession, it is too sweet to resign easily; and the
<i>Fermeurs Genereaux</i> are too important to be offended, especially,
when the state is necessitated to have recourse to their assistance.
In saying this, I give full credit to Mons. Neckar for his attempt
to improve the revenue of France, and that too, when the attempt
is surrounded with so much difficulty and danger.⸺The revenue
of this country, Sir, has not suffered by the American war; the surpluses
of the sinking fund, are as great as during the state of perfect
peace with America. Other countries have taken from us those
manufactures which we exported before with bounties to America.</p>

<p>As I think Britain is still equal to resist, and, I trust, to subdue
all its Enemies, I am clearly for the Motion which has been proposed,
and seconded, by the honourable Gentlemen, with so much
credit to themselves, and with so particular a desert of the approbation
of their Country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gen. C[o]n[wa]y.</div>

<p><i>Gen. C[o]n[wa]y.</i> Mr. Sp[eake]r, I beg pardon for troubling
the House with one short word, Sir, at this late hour of the night,
Sir, when there are many Gentlemen very desirous⸺and much
more capable than I am, of speaking—upon so material—so important—so
comprehensive a business—I may say, Sir—as that
which now immediately comes before us—for our deliberation.⸺In
doing this, Sir—in offering my poor sentiments—upon this
matter, Sir⸺I own, I feel some degree of warmth, at the supineness—at
the coolness—I may say—of the Ministers in so dangerous—so
hazardous—and, God knows, probably so destructive an hour⸺And,
Sir, I hope I may suggest my thoughts at so critical
a period, when, indeed, all Europe and America are convulsed—and
shaken—by the imbecillity, the inattention, and the indecision
of Ministers; who have so supinely, so cooly, and so indecisively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
sat <i>with their hands before them</i>, waiting for events—and
contingencies⸺In saying this, Sir,—I mean not to throw any
reflexion upon any of them—Most of them I know to be men of
honour and ability—but, Sir, I beg pardon, Sir, for taking up the
time of the house, Sir; I think the moment is past when any system
can prevail, I mean on the part of this country over America. Your
West-India Islands are unprotected—Dominica is gone—Who
knows but Jamaica is gone too? What force have you at Antigua?
I understand, Admiral Barrington is gone from Barbadoes. What
is to become of St. Vincents and Grenada? Good God! Sir, will the
Nation sit still under these apprehensions? Have Ministers taken
care of Ireland? Does the Noble Lord underneath me know the
state of Guernsey and Jersey? Will they be able to resist Count Broglio
with 50,000 men? Is your force, particularly at Jersey,
equal to resistance—Sir, at this moment, I tremble for Jersey.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>⸺</p>

<p>In one short word, Sir, I beg pardon—I do trust in God, Sir
... in the King ... Sir, and in the spirit of this unhappy Nation,
Sir, that we shall be relieved from these dreadful apprehensions,
and difficulties, and that we shall see once more, Peace,
Harmony, and Wisdom, resume their order in this country, in
the stead of weakness, irresolution, wavering folly, absurd doubts,
and indecision, Sir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr S[aw]b[rid]ge.</div>

<p>Mr <i>S[aw]b[rid]ge</i>⸺Example—impeachment—axes—Tower—blood—Sister

Capo</i>.</p>

<p>The question being now called for with most violent impatience,
the House prepared to divide.⸺The Editor cannot
but lament that the eloquence of the day is compriseable in so
small a compass.—He regrets, with many others, the silence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
those who might have been supposed, from attachment, from
principle, and a sense of honour, to have taken a more decided
part in the debate. Probably it might be considered too severe to
impute the conduct of those Gentlemen to the precariousness of
the times, to the expectation of new Administrations, or to the
fretfulness of an insatiable avarice of wealth and power.</p>

<p>Little more remains to add, than that the House having become
very clamorous for a division, at half past three the question on
the Amendment being put, the motion was rejected by a majority
of 261 to 148. Tellers for the Ayes, Mr T. T[ownshe]nd and
Mr B[y]ng—for the Noes, Sir G[re]y C[oope]r and Mr
C[harles] T[ownshe]nd.⸺The main question being then
put, the original Address was carried in nearly the same proportion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Immediately after the division, the H[ous]e were much astonished
at Mr C[harle]s T[u]rn[e]r’s calling their attention to a
most libellous, nefarious, and enormous pamphlet, entitled <i>Anticipation</i>,
calculated to misrepresent the debates, and vilify the proceedings
of P[arliamen]t; observing, that the publication of Honourable
Gentlemen’s speeches <i>before</i> they could possibly have been
spoken, was infinitely more dangerous to the constitution than
mistaking them after they had actually been delivered; as not only
the public were thereby much more likely to be deceived, but
many country Gentlemen were most illegally hurried up to town
before the time, to the great annoyance of themselves and cattle.
Besides, what struck at the very heart-strings of debate, many
good speeches were marred thereby, and Honourable Gentlemen
stopt from repeating their own words, lest they should authenticate
the said publication.</p>

<p>For all which reasons, he humbly moved, that the Publisher
of a pamphlet, entitled, <i>Anticipation</i>, be immediately taken into
custody by a Messenger of this House, together with all papers in
his shops and warehouses, in order that this House may be enabled
to discover the Author or Authors of this very black conspiracy.
He moved also, that the several statutes against forgery, coining,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
and uttering, knowing to be false, forestallers, and regraters, &amp;c.
&amp;c. be forthwith all read. And further⸺But, the laughter
having now become intense, the remnant of his oratory was cut
short by a most clamorous repetition of <i>Adjourn</i>, <i>Adjourn</i>; so
that it was impossible for the Editor to collect the result of this
important motion.</p>

<p>And then the House adjourned till the morning, nine of the
clock.</p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 22</span></h4>

<p><i>The Gentlemen trading to the East-Indies, &amp;c.</i> The publisher’s advertisement
burlesques a practice of the bookseller John Almon (1737-1805), friend
and biographer of John Wilkes, and between the years 1761-81 publisher-in-ordinary
to the Whig Opposition. Almon had extensive connections in the
American colonies and was the compiler of <i>The Remembrancer</i>, 1775-84, a
valuable collection of materials relating to the Revolution. In his satire on the
French ministry, <i>The Green Box of Monsieur de Sartine</i>, 1779, Tickell
represents a French spy in London reporting ruefully:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">News-papers, pamphlets, parliamentary debates, remembrancers, and all
the infinite variety of periodical libels, under the conduct of our good
friend Mr. Almon, leave but a scanty and beaten field of politics for
private discovery (pp. 12-13).</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 23</span></h4>

<p><i>Sir Francis Molyneux.</i> Sir Francis Molyneux (d. 1812), Knt.; succeeded his
father as seventh Baronet, 1781.</p>

<p><i>the Speaker.</i> Sir Fletcher Norton (1716-1789), Knt.; M.P. for Guildford;
Speaker of the House of Commons, 1770-80; cr. Baron Grantley of Markenfield,
1782.</p>

<p><i>the merit of those speeches.</i> Since the speech from the throne rarely contains
more than generalities, Tickell was able to approximate its substance fairly
closely. In the debate on the opening day John Wilkes had the temerity to
say that there were only two particulars in the King’s speech to which he
could assent: “They are, that we are called together in a conjuncture, which
demands our most serious attention, and that a restoration of the blessings of
peace ought to be our first wish” (<i>Parliamentary History</i>, XIX, 1334).</p>

<p><i>the new Attorney General.</i> Alexander Wedderburn (1733-1805), M.P.
for Bishop’s Castle; succeeded Edward Thurlow as Attorney-General, June
1778; elevated to the Chief Justiceship of the Common Pleas as Baron
Loughborough of Loughborough, 1780; cr. Earl of Rosslyn, 1801. In the
spring of 1778 Sir Fletcher Norton, by a threat of impeachment, had blocked
Wedderburn’s intrigue to obtain the Chief Justiceship; see Walpole to Mason,
31 May 1778 (<i>Letters</i>, ed. Toynbee, X, 254).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 25</span></h4>

<p><i>Lord Granby.</i> Charles Manners (1754-1787), second son of the Marquis
of Granby famous as a military hero; M.P. for Cambridge University; succeeded
his grandfather as fourth Duke of Rutland, 1779.</p>

<p><i>Pulteny.</i> Sir William Pulteney (1684-1764), Earl of Bath; long the leader
of the “patriot” opposition during Sir Robert Walpole’s administration, but
politically ruined by his acceptance, upon Walpole’s fall, of an earldom.</p>

<p><i>Cavendish ... Meredith ... Young.</i> Three supporters of the Whig
Opposition: John Cavendish (1732-1796), fourth son of the third Duke
of Devonshire, M.P. for York, friend and correspondent of Burke; Sir William
Meredith (1725?-1790), third Baronet, M.P. for Liverpool; Sir George
Yonge (1731-1812), fifth Baronet, M.P. for Honiton.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 26</span></h4>

<p><i>that inestimable character of our own times.</i> William Pitt (1708-1778),
first Earl of Chatham. The “Great Commoner’s” acceptance of a peerage in
1766 occasioned a storm of popular indignation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 27</span></h4>

<p><i>Admiral Keppel ... Vice Admiral Sir Hugh Palliser.</i> Augustus Keppel
(1725-1786), second son of the second Earl of Albemarle; M.P. for Windsor;
Admiral of the Blue and Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet,
1778; cr. Viscount Keppel, 1782. Sir Hugh Palliser (1723-1796), first
Baronet; M.P. for Scarborough and a Lord of the Admiralty; Vice-Admiral
of the Blue, 1778.</p>

<p>The allusions are to the indecisive action off Ushant between the Channel
fleet under Keppel, with Palliser as third in command, and the Brest fleet
under D’Orvilliers, 27 July 1778; see Introduction, p. 10. On the third
day of the session an altercation broke out in the House of Commons between
the two admirals, and a few days later Palliser applied to his colleagues at
the Admiralty Board for a court-martial on Keppel. After a protracted trial
the court declared Palliser’s charges “malicious and ill-founded.” This verdict
so delighted the populace that street riots ensued in which the Admiralty
was attacked and Palliser’s house in Pall-Mall was gutted. Palliser was obliged
to resign all his public appointments. See Sir G. O. Trevelyan, <i>George the
Third and Charles James Fox: The Concluding Part of the American Revolution</i>,
New York, 1912-14, I, ch. v.</p>

<p><i>David Hartly, Esq.</i> David Hartley the younger (1732-1813), son of the
philosopher; M.P. for Kingston-upon-Hull; published <i>Letters on the American
War</i>, 1777-79, which critically reviewed the history of British colonial
policy; friend and correspondent of Franklin (whose letters he sometimes
read in the House of Commons); British plenipotentiary at Paris to negotiate
peace with America, 1783. He was the Cassandra of the House and a tireless
advocate of peace, but his long-windedness made him disliked. In <i>The Abbey
of Kilkhampton</i>, 1780, Sir Herbert Croft’s satirical garland of epitaphs,
Hartley’s epitaph reads as follows (Part II, p. 124):</p>

<p class="center">Here rests,<br />
If we may trust the Silence of his Grave,<br />
D.... H....y, Esq.<br />

But⸺he was <i>troublesome</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bamber Gascoyne.</i> Bamber Gascoyne (1725-1791), M.P. for Truro
and a Lord of Trade and Plantations. Of this footnote and the speech by
Hartley, <i>The London Magazine</i> observed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The description of a certain fat member heading the dinner troop
and drawing them out of the house, upon a dry, metaphysical, long
winded speaker getting up, is truly characteristic; and strangers frequenting
the gallery may congratulate themselves on this happy stroke,
for it has partly silenced the tedious declaimer, who never considered
that if each speaker claimed the same right, to pay no regard to time,
a whole session might be passed in adjourned debates from <i>three</i> in the
afternoon to <i>three</i> in the morning, day after day (XLVII, 566).</p>

Major-General and Commander-in-Chief in Ireland; famous for his
sartorial elegance and convivial habits.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Selwyn.</i> George Augustus Selwyn (1719-1791), M.P. for Gloucester;
the celebrated wit and club-man. Though he sat in Parliament for about
thirty years, Selwyn was notoriously apathetic towards politics. But since he
returned two members besides himself, and always woke up in time to give
his vote for the ministers when a division was called, Selwyn was amply
rewarded by successive administrations. He was, wrote Sir George Otto
Trevelyan,</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 30</span></h4>

<p><i>Mr. Wilkes.</i> John Wilkes (1727-1797), M.P. for Middlesex; the radical
politician and hero of the London populace. He had a reputation for facetious
wit, and he made a practice of sending his speeches in advance to the newspapers.
Wilkes was another, like Fox and Burke, who enjoyed Tickell’s
anticipation of his speech. Boswell reported Wilkes as saying to Tickell in
April 1779: “Much obliged for your speech for me. If you’ll make me another
for next session, I’ll be damn’d if I don’t speak it” (<i>Private Papers of
James Boswell</i>, XIII, 231).</p>

<p><i>Here Sir Grey Cooper caught at a pen.</i> Sir Grey Cooper (1726?-1801),

<p><i>magic plates.</i> Hartley had invented an arrangement of thin iron strips to
be placed as a lining under floors and above ceilings to prevent fire. An
anonymous handbill of four quarto pages, dated July 1776 and called <i>An

<p><i>the Noble Lord, who presided in the American department.</i> George Sackville
Germain (1716-1785), called Lord George Germain, third son of the
first Duke of Dorset; M.P. for East Grinstead and Secretary of State for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Colonies; cr. Viscount Sackville, 1782. As minister in charge of military
operations in America, Germain bore the brunt of frequent and savage onslaughts
by Opposition. His famous Kentish holiday, which delayed dispatches
to Sir William Howe in New York, was long supposed to have caused Burgoyne’s
defeat at Saratoga; Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, <i>Life of William,
Earl of Shelburne</i>, 1875-76, I, 358-359; but cf. Troyer Steele Anderson,
<i>The Command of the Howe Brothers during the American Revolution</i>,
New York, 1936, ch. xiv. Germain’s resignation was forced in January 1782,
two months before North’s government fell.</p>

<p><i>the Earl of Bute.</i> John Stuart (1713-1792), third Earl of Bute; favorite
of George III in the early years of the reign; First Lord of the Treasury,
1762-63, but forced to resign on account of his unpopularity, to which the
anti-Scots propaganda of Wilkes largely contributed. Lord North was popularly
regarded as the political heir of Lord Bute.</p>

letter to Laurens, 10 June 1778, soliciting a private interview. This letter,
with Laurens’ answer, was promptly made public by Congress.</p>

<p><i>Ethan Allen.</i> Ethan Allen (1738-1789), famous for his partisan exploits as

<p><i>Governor Johnson.</i> George Johnstone (1730-1787), M.P. for Appleby;
formerly Governor of West Florida; one of North’s commissioners to treat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
with America; see Introduction, p. 9. His conduct as commissioner was quarrelsome,
clumsy, and ineffectual; Carl Van Doren, <i>Secret History of the American
Revolution</i>, New York, 1941, pp. 96-104. Of his speech on the opening day
of the session Walpole reported:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Governor Johnston made a strange, unintelligible speech (it was impossible
for him to make a clear one without condemning himself); he
endeavoured to wipe off some of his attempt to bribe some of the Congress,
yet owned at much as he denied, condemned and approved the
march to Philadelphia, and rather insinuated blame on Keppel than on
anybody else. He was soon after called upon in several newspapers to
say, whether he did not still retain his pay of Commissioner, though he
had so long quitted the office. He made no answer—consequently was
by that sinecure retained by the Court (<i>Last Journals</i>, II, 209).</p>

<p><i>Mons. D’Estaign.</i> Jean-Baptiste-Charles-Henri-Hector, Comte d’Estaing

peerage of Ireland; M.P. for Dartmouth; Vice-Admiral; Commander-in-Chief
on the North American station, 1776-78; resigned his command because
of discontent with the ministry, September 1778; cr. an English peer,
1782, and Earl Howe, 1788.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Rigby.</i> Richard Rigby (1722-1788), M.P. for Tavistock and Paymaster
of the Forces. Reputed to have derived immense profits from his office during
the American war, Rigby served as the model for Disraeli’s corrupt
politician of the same name in <i>Coningsby</i>, 1844.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 35</span></h4>

<p><i>Mr. T. Townsend.</i> Thomas Townshend (1733-1800), nephew of the third
Viscount Townshend; M.P. for Whitchurch, 1754-83; cr. Baron Sydney of
Chislehurst, 1783, and Viscount Sydney, 1789, the city in Australia being
named for him. He was one of the most voluble and pertinacious speakers
in debates. His contemptuous reference in the House of Commons to Johnson’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
pension earned Townshend a passing glance in Goldsmith’s <i>Retaliation</i>,
where Burke is said to be,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 36</span></h4>

<p><i>the blunders of Administration, with respect to Falkland’s Islands, &amp;c.</i>
Townshend views with alarm an assortment of the events, momentous and
trivial, that had agitated the public mind in the preceding decade.</p>

<p>As to <i>Falkland’s Islands</i>, west of the southern tip of South America, a
dispute over their possession nearly brought on war between Great Britain and
Spain in 1770-71. After a display of force by Spain and a demand for
restitution by the British government, diplomatic exchanges resulted in a
conciliation that was unpopular in England (<i>The Annual Register</i> for 1771,
“History of Europe,” chs. i-v). At the request of the ministers, Dr. Johnson
wrote a spirited defence of their conduct, <i>Thoughts on the Late Transactions
respecting Falkland’s Islands</i>, 1771.</p>

<p>The <i>Middlesex Election</i> was a remarkable exploit in the career of John
Wilkes, who in 1768 returned from France still an outlaw for his offence
in <i>North Briton</i> No. 45, and was elected to Parliament for the county of
Middlesex. Expelled before he could take his seat, he was thrice re-elected
and as many times expelled. After his fourth victory at the polls Parliament
declared his opponent, the ministerial candidate, duly elected. This breach
of electoral rights led to street-rioting, protracted debates in and out of
Parliament, and, eventually, the formation of a Radical party. See Horace
Bleackley, <i>Life of John Wilkes</i>, 1917, chs. xii-xiii.</p>

<p>The revolt of <i>Corsica</i> under Pasquale Paoli against the French, who had
purchased the island from Genoa in 1768, won wide public sympathy in
England. The leading advocate of British intervention in favor of the
Corsicans was James Boswell. See Chauncey Brewster Tinker, <i>Nature’s Simple
Plan</i>, Princeton, 1922, ch. ii.</p>

<p>The <i>massacre in St. George’s Fields</i>, 10 May 1768, occurred when a crowd
of London citizens waiting for Wilkes to attend the opening of Parliament
taunted a detachment of foot-guards into firing on them. Several persons
were killed and about a dozen wounded. This “massacre” was the forerunner
and partly the inspiration of that in King Street, Boston, two years later.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Horne’s imprisonment</i> resulted from the zeal of that radical parson in
the cause of America. The Rev. John Horne (1736-1812), afterwards
Horne Tooke, wrote and circulated an advertisement for the Constitutional
Society, June 1775, stating that 100<i>l.</i> was to be raised for “the relief of the
widows, orphans, and aged parents of our beloved American fellow-subjects,
who, faithful to the character of Englishmen, preferring death to slavery,
were, for that reason only, inhumanly murdered by the king’s troops” at Lexington
and Concord on the 19th of April. In July 1777 Horne was brought to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
trial before Lord Mansfield, found guilty, and in November sentenced to a
year’s imprisonment and a fine of 200<i>l.</i> (<i>The Annual Register</i> for 1777,
“Appendix to the Chronicle,” pp. 234-245).</p>

<p>The <i>fatal example of the Justitia</i> is an allusion to the <i>Justitia</i> hulk, a convict-ship
stationed at Woolwich by an act of 1776 for the purpose of dredging
the Thames.</p>

<p>The <i>frequent exhibition of the Beggar’s Opera</i> evidently alludes to remarks
by Townshend that had excited mirth in a debate on a bill for licensing a
play-house in Birmingham, 29 April 1777. Townshend opposed the bill
because, he said,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">He had heard from good authority that the theatre licensed at Manchester,
in consequence of a similar application, had done a great deal
of mischief already: nor could it be wondered at, if we consider what
pieces are sometimes represented, which, not being new, are not subject
to the controul of the Lord Chamberlain: the Beggar’s Opera, for instance,
which had brought more unhappy people to the gallows, than
any one thing he could name. As to the country gentlemen, surely this
was not such an age of domestic retirement, but what they might find
sufficient amusement in visiting their neighbours in the summer, without
wanting to frequent a theatre.... Considering, then, the circumstances
of Birmingham as a great manufacturing and trading town,
depending on the industry and frugality of the poorer class of people,
he was of opinion it would be highly improper to license any theatre
there (<i>Parliamentary History</i>, XIX, 202).</p>

</div>

<p><i>Is Omiah to pay us another visit?</i> Omiah or Omai, a native of Otaheite
(Tahiti), was brought to England in 1774 by Captain Tobias Furneaux of
the <i>Adventure</i>. As the first South Sea Islander ever seen in England, Omiah
made a stir in fashionable and literary society, sat for his portrait to the
most eminent artists, and was the subject of countless newspaper paragraphs
and several pamphlet poems. There are well-known lines by Cowper on
Omiah in the first book of <i>The Task</i>, 1785:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><i>Sir Harry Clinton.</i> Sir Henry Clinton (1738?-1795), K.B.; Major-General;
succeeded Sir William Howe as Commander-in-Chief in America,
May 1778.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 37</span></h4>

<p><i>Mr. Vyner.</i> Robert Vyner (1717-1799), M.P. for Lincoln. He was, said
Nathaniel Wraxall, a gentleman of large property in Lincolnshire, whose
person suggested “the portraits of ‘Hudibras’” (<i>Historical and Posthumous
Memoirs ... 1772-1784</i>, ed. H. B. Wheatley, 1884, V, 203).</p>

<p><i>his offer of fifteen shillings in the pound.</i> In a debate on the budget, 3 May
1775, Vyner defended the motives of the country gentlemen in supporting
the ministers’ coercive American policy. He said, in part:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">In support of such a cause ... he was willing to pay not only 4s. but
14s. in the pound: and as he entertained not a single doubt but we
should prevail in the contest, we ought to oblige America to pay the
expence she had wantonly put us to, and which would likewise enable
us to bring back our quondam peace establishment, that of a land-tax
of 2s. in the pound (<i>Parliamentary History</i>, XVIII, 625).</p>

<p><i>Mr. Van.</i> Charles Van, prior to his death, in April 1778, M.P. for Brecon.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 38</span></h4>

<p><i>Hon. T. Luttrel.</i> Temple Simon Luttrell (d. 1803), third son of the first
Earl of Carhampton; M.P. for Milborne Port. A florid orator, Luttrell was
always pertinacious in debates on naval affairs. Tickell’s parody perhaps
reflects an interminable speech on the state of the navy, 11 March 1778, in
which Luttrell described the timber used for ship-repairs as so “singularly
spungy and porous” that “your seamen ... are frequently set afloat in their
hammocks, from the water soaking in, over-head, through the planks,” related
an instance of a seaman’s driving his fist, “without much pain to his
knuckles,” through the hull of a man-of-war, and entered into a detail of
the twenty-four invasions of Great Britain and Ireland since the Norman
Conquest (<i>Parliamentary History</i>, XIX, 874-892).</p>

<p><i>the noble Earl who is now at the head of that department.</i> John Montagu
(1718-1792), fourth Earl of Sandwich; First Lord of the Admiralty. Sandwich
was notorious for the dissoluteness of his private life.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 40</span></h4>

<p><i>Regattaites.</i> Not a tribe or nation, but participants in the summer regattas
on the Thames. In <i>The Annual Register</i> for 1775 appears “Some Account of
the new Entertainment, called a <i>Regatta</i>, introduced from <i>Venice</i> into <i>England</i>,
in the Course of the Year 1775,” from which the following sentences
are extracted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Before five o’clock, Westminster bridge was covered with spectators,
in carriages and on foot, and men even placed themselves in the bodies
of the lamp-irons. Plans of the regatta were sold from a shilling to a
penny each, and songs on the occasion sung, in which <i>Regatta</i> was the
rhyme for <i>Ranelagh</i>, and <i>Royal Family</i> echoed to <i>Liberty</i>.... Before
six o’clock it was a perfect fair on both sides the water, and bad liquor,
with short measure, was plentifully retailed.... The Thames was
now a floating town. All the cutters, sailing-boats, &amp;c. in short, every
thing, from the dung-barge to the wherry, was in motion (“Appendix to
the Chronicle,” pp. 216, 217).</p>

</div>

<p><i>the Captain of the Licorne.</i> The <i>Licorne</i> frigate, encountered and detained
by Admiral Keppel on the 17th of June, yielded Keppel information respecting
the strength of the French fleet.</p>

<p><i>the wretched deficiency in our late naval equipments.</i> War-profiteering is
not of recent origin; in the Eighteenth Century the loose organization of
finance and supply in both services gave large opportunities to contractors and
commissaries. “You must not think of persuading us that you are no gainer,”
Lord Loudoun remarked to Benjamin Franklin when the latter sought reimbursement
for outlays in connection with Braddock’s expedition in 1755;
“we understand better those affairs, and know that every one concerned in
supplying the army finds means, in the doing it, to fill his own pockets”
(Franklin, <i>Writings</i>, ed. A. H. Smyth, New York, 1905-07, I, 430). Satirists
frequently exposed this form of parasitism. Samuel Foote produced a
comedy called <i>The Commissary</i> in 1765. In Sheridan’s <i>The Camp</i>, 1778,
the commissary Gage supplied a regiment with lime (which he dug himself,
at no expense) instead of hair-powder. It did very well, he reported, while
the weather was fine, but when a shower came up the troops’ heads were
all slacked in an instant. “I stood a near chance of being tied up to the halberts;
but I excused myself by saying, they looked only like raw recruits
before; but now they appeared like old veterans of service” (I, i).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 42</span></h4>

<p><i>Mr. Penton.</i> Henry Penton (1736-1812), M.P. for Winchester and a Lord
of the Admiralty.</p>

<p><i>a certain Great Personage.</i> On their tour of the militia camps at Winchester
and Salisbury in September, the King and Queen “alighted at Mr. Penton’s
house [in Winchester], where they were waited on by the Mayor and
Corporation” (<i>The Annual Register</i> for 1778, “Appendix to the Chronicle,”
p. 235).</p>

<p><i>Mr. Burke.</i> Edmund Burke (1729-1797), M.P. for Bristol. The dominant
theme of Burke’s speech, “the ruin of this declining empire” was a favorite
one among anti-ministerial orators, pamphleteers, and poets during the Revolution.
Soon after the appearance, in 1781, of the second and third volumes
of Gibbon’s <i>Decline and Fall</i>, Thomas Powys, M.P. for Northamptonshire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
read extracts from that work in a debate on a motion for putting an end to
the American war. Powys ventured to say that the description of Rome in the
Fifth Century by Mr. Gibbon,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">whose enrolment in the administration was the only accession of which
his Majesty’s ministers had to boast, ... was so strong, so expressive,
so applicable, that though it was said to belong to Rome, he could not
help thinking that it alluded to a nearer country, and a nearer period
(<i>Parliamentary History</i>, XXII, 805).</p>

<p><i>the pageantry of domestic warfare.</i> An allusion to the vogue of the militia
encampments as places of fashionable resort.</p>

<p><i>important depredations at—Martha’s Island.</i> Early in September Major-General
Grey, under orders from Sir Henry Clinton, invested Martha’s
Vineyard and carried off “a considerable and most desirable contribution,
consisting of 10,000 sheep, and 300 oxen, for the public service at New
York” (<i>The Annual Register</i> for 1779, “History of Europe,” p. 2).</p>

<p><i>Mr Fox.</i> Charles James Fox (1749-1806), third son of the first Baron Holland;
M.P. for Malmesbury and leader of the Opposition in the House of
Commons. Either out of personal regard for Fox or at the request of Lord
North, Tickell does not burlesque Fox’s oratory. It is stated in the review of
<i>Anticipation</i> in <i>The Town and Country Magazine</i> that Fox’s speech actually
“was noticed by that gentleman in the house, who, at the same time, lamented
his incapacity of making so good an harangue upon the occasion” (XI, 1779,
45). According to a note in Horace Walpole’s copy of <i>Anticipation</i>, “Charles
Fox said, ‘he has anticipated many things I have intended to say, but I shall say
them nevertheless.’”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 48</span></h4>

<p><i>General Lee.</i> Charles Lee (1731-1782), Lieutenant-Colonel in the British
army; appointed Major-General by Congress, 1775; court-martialed and suspended
from service for disobedience to orders and misbehavior before the
enemy during the battle of Monmouth Court House, June 1778.</p>

<p><i>the Prince of Brunswick.</i> Either Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick (1721-1792),
Commander of the English and Hanoverian forces in the Seven Years’
War; or his nephew, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand (1735-1806), Hereditary
Prince of Brunswick, who commanded a division in his uncle’s army. Clinton
served in Germany, 1760-63, acting for a time as aide-de-camp to the Hereditary
Prince.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Page 58</span></h4>

<p><i>Col. Barré.</i> Isaac Barré (1726-1802), M.P. for Calne. Barré, who had served
with Wolfe in America, was a devoted friend of the colonists and in Parliament
was regarded as a master of invective and the special antagonist of Lord North.
North had his revenge in <i>Anticipation</i>; see Introduction, p. 12.</p>

<p><i>the Indians, headed by Col. Butler, began their rapine in Cherry Valley.</i> John
Butler (1725-1796), Indian agent under the Johnsons in the Mohawk Valley;
Lieutenant-Colonel of Militia, 1768; Major in command of Butler’s Rangers,
1777. Under his leadership parties of Loyalists and their Indian allies of the
Six Nations systematically harried the back settlements in New York and Pennsylvania
during the Revolution. Their raids reached a peak of frequency and
destructiveness in the early summer of 1778, the notorious “Wyoming Massacre”
occurring 3-4 July. None of the settlements mentioned by Barré had
been attacked at the time his informant is supposed to have written; but rumors
were rife on the frontier as well as at the Poughkeepsie headquarters of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Continental Army; and the worst fears of the settlers were realized when Butler’s
son, Captain Walter Butler, together with the Mohawk chief Joseph Brant,
sacked the village of Cherry Valley on the 11th of November. See Howard Swiggett,
<i>War out of Niagara: Walter Butler and the Tory Rangers</i>, New York,
1933, chs. vi-vii.</p>

of Quebec, 1775-78; requested his recall because of differences with Lord
George Germain, May 1777; cr. Baron Dorchester of Dorchester (Oxford),
1786.</p>

<p><i>Miss Macrea.</i> Jane MacCrea, daughter of a Tory clergyman residing near
Fort Edward on the upper Hudson, was scalped by a marauding party of Burgoyne’s
Indian allies, 27 July 1777. This incident, about which a mass of romantic
legend soon grew up, proved highly embarrassing to Burgoyne and the
Administration.</p>

<p><i>no Secretary of War in this house.</i> “Ld Barrington [William Wildman Barrington
(1717-1793), second Viscount] was out of Parliament, and no successor
was then appointed” (note by Horace Walpole in his copy of <i>Anticipation</i>). Barrington,
Secretary at War since 1765, had given notice of his retirement in the
previous May; in December Charles Jenkinson was named his successor.</p>

the expedition against the Falkland Islands that led to the surrender of the
English garrison at Port Egmont, June 1770, and aroused great indignation in
England; see above, note to p. 36, on Falkland’s Islands. Probably a member
of the family of Bucareli y Ursúa, of Seville, several of whom held high military
and colonial posts at that period.</p>

<p><i>Count Cobentzel.</i> This may refer either to Johann Philipp, Graf von Cobenzl
(1741-1810), Austrian statesman who drafted the Peace of Teschen, 1779; or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
to his cousin, Johann Ludwig Joseph, Graf von Cobenzl (1753-1809), Austrian
Ambassador to the Court of Catherine II, 1779-97.</p>

<p>Prologue to the Camp. Written by Richard Tickell, Esq.</p>

<p class="tb">This entry is from <i>The London Chronicle</i>, 23 October 1778. Though
printed in several magazines at the time of the production, the Prologue
seems first to have accompanied the text of the play in John Murray’s edition
of Sheridan’s <i>Works</i>, 1821, II, 161-162.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><i>The Camp</i>, “a musical entertainment,” was first performed 15 October 1778, at
Drury Lane Theatre; it was first printed, without publisher’s name, London, 1795.
Sheridan’s authorship was universally accepted by the press of the time and in the
early biographical notices of Sheridan; see R. Crompton Rhodes’ edition of Sheridan’s
<i>Plays and Poems</i>, New York, 1929, II, 271. The first to question it was Tate Wilkinson,
who asserted that Sheridan “never wrote a line” of this “catchpenny for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
time” (<i>The Wandering Patentee</i>, York, 1795, IV, 124). Later, Thomas Moore likewise
thought <i>The Camp</i> “unworthy” of Sheridan’s genius and declared, on the evidence
of a rough copy in Tickell’s hand, that Tickell was the author (<i>Sheridan</i>, 2nd
ed., 1825, I, 264). Following Moore, some editors have omitted it from editions of
Sheridan. Library catalogues and recent bibliographies, apparently following Walter
Sichel (<i>Sheridan</i>, I, 443), whose statements on these matters are sometimes merely
conjectures, generally assign <i>The Camp</i> to Tickell as “revised” by Sheridan.</p>

<p>A rough copy in Tickell’s hand is very inconclusive evidence of his authorship.
In view of known “catchpenny” work by Sheridan, the alleged inferiority of <i>The
Camp</i> is still less conclusive. Tickell may of course have contributed to the dialogue,
as he later did in many of the Drury Lane productions. But there are no adequate
grounds for denying the contemporary attribution to Sheridan.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Of the numerous continuations and imitations that appeared in the next few years,
none except <i>Common-Place Arguments</i>, 1780 (no. viii, below), is by Tickell. <i>Opposition
Mornings: with Betty’s Remarks</i>, J. Wilkie, 1779, is assigned to him in Halkett
and Laing (<i>Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous Literature</i>, new ed., Edinburgh,
1926-34, IV, 265), in Sabin (#95797), and in library catalogues generally.
Not made by earlier bibliographers, this attribution is probably based on a
conjecture in <i>The Monthly Review</i> that <i>Opposition Mornings</i> might be an inferior
work by Tickell (LX, 1779, 473). The tract makes use of several of Tickell’s satirical
devices of the kind easily borrowed. But there is no good evidence that he wrote
it, and the lack of a spark of wit in the whole performance is strong evidence to
the contrary.</p>

<p>Sixième Edition, with identical title (except for change in number of
edition), identical imprint and date; the text is set largely from the same
type but extended by new matter to p. 76, and there is no blank page at
the end. The Cinquième Edition described above may be safely regarded
as the <i>editio princeps</i>; there were, however, at least three variant issues, two
of which are easily confused with the original edition. One of these corresponds
exactly in imprint, pagination, and signatures with the regular
Cinquième Edition but is set from different type, has a different title-page
border, and uses less elaborate printer’s ornaments throughout; it may be
at once distinguished from the original by the fact that the words “Monsieur
de Sartine” in the title are printed, not in red as in the original, but
in black; copies in <span class="allsmcap">BA</span>, <span class="allsmcap">NYP</span>. A second variant has the same imprint as
the regular Cinquième Edition, but the title-page has a still different border,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
no rubrication, and the word “Cinquième” is erroneously printed with
an acute instead of a grave accent; the pagination is the same as that of
the regular Cinquième Edition, but the variant is a smaller octavo, the type
is not the same, nor are the signatures (regular: []², B-K⁴; variant:
[]², B-E⁸, F⁴); copies in <span class="allsmcap">NYP</span>, <span class="allsmcap">YU</span>. There is, finally, in the Yale University
Library an issue called the “Cinquieme [<i>sic</i>] édition,” with a title-page
border different from any in the preceding issues, with the same
pagination as the regular Cinquième Edition, but from different type, with
signatures[]¹, B⁸, C-I⁴ (half-title doubtless wanting), and with the
puzzling date “M. DCC. LXXXII.”</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><i>La Cassette verte</i> is a political and bibliographical hoax. The text purports to be
secret papers found in a dispatch-box belonging to M. de Sartine, French Minister
of Marine. (On Mademoiselle Du Thé, i.e., Rosalie Duthé, a Parisian courtesan who
had recently visited England, see Pierre Larousse, <i>Grand dictionnaire ... du XIXᵉ
siècle</i>, Paris, 1866-90, VI, 1447-1448.) The papers expose the motives of the French
government in aiding the United States and satirize Franklin’s activities in Paris,
English sympathizers with the American cause, and the like. A letter supposedly written
by one of Sartine’s agents in London provides a gloss on certain passages in
<i>Anticipation</i>. I quote from the English version (no. vi, below):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Alas! in these times, a spy’s office here is almost a sinecure: a dozen newspapers
in the morning, and as many fresh ones every evening, rob us of all
our business: a secret even in private affairs is a prodigy in London; but as to
public matters, it is the patriot’s boast, that a free constitution abhors secrecy:
and so indeed it seems; for, not only the minutest accounts of the army, the
navy, and the taxes, but the minister’s letters, official instructions, and in short,
every paper, the disclosure of which may serve opposition, and tend to prejudice
the ministers by a premature discovery of their plans, are perpetually
called for, and must lie on the tables of Parliament; where, as soon as they
are once brought, their contents one way or other get into print; consequently,
... the French ministers are not only as much in possession of them as the
English, but study them far more attentively, and to ten times more advantage
than <i>they</i> do who called for their disclosure in England⸺All this is bad encouragement
to a spy at London.</p>

</div>

<p>Bibliographically, the pamphlet raises questions that cannot be answered with complete
certainty. How is the number of variant issues to be accounted for, and what
are their relations to the <i>editio princeps</i>? The satire was originally written by Tickell
in English and was then translated into bad French to circulate on the Continent
as propaganda against the Franco-American alliance (see the extract from <i>The

on in the present entry). However, the French version, purporting to be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
“Cinquième Edition,” published “A La Haye,” and “revue &amp; corrigée sur celles de
Leipsic &amp; d’Amsterdam,” appeared in England earlier than the English original (<i>La
Cassette verte</i> was noticed in <i>The Monthly Review</i> for May 1779, p. 394; <i>The
Green Box</i> in the following month, p. 473). It seems most likely that the regular
Cinquième and the Sixième Editions were printed on the Continent and that the variant
issues were English reprints. Typographical evidence tends to confirm this supposition.
The type and ornaments of the regular Cinquième Edition and the Sixième
seem clearly not to be English. The variants, on the other hand, all appear to be
English in origin, and it may be noted that their less elaborate ornaments give the
impression of feeble imitation.</p>

<p>There is evidence that the hoax was disliked in certain high quarters. In Louis
Petit de Bachaumont’s <i>Mémoires secrets pour servir à l’histoire de la republique des
lettres en France</i>, 1780-89, appears an “Extrait d’une lettre d’Amsterdam du 22 Mai
1780,” which reads, in part:</p>

The <i>Epistle</i> was very highly praised by the reviewers and by others, but Horace
Walpole, in a letter to Lady Ossory of 2 December 1779, recorded an acute dissent:
“Towards the end there seems some very pretty lines; but, upon the whole, <i>à quoi bon?

flashed in the pan (<i>Letters</i>, ed. Toynbee, XI, 74-75).”</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>This pastoral opera in two acts, performed as an afterpiece at Drury Lane, 29
October 1781, is an alteration of Allan Ramsay’s <i>Gentle Shepherd</i>, 1725, which had
already had a long stage history. It ran for twenty-two nights and remained the
standard stage version until after 1800. In an article entitled “Reviving ‘The Gentle
Shepherd,’” W. J. Lawrence condemned Tickell’s alteration out of hand because
“the abounding Doric had been bled white, and new music had been substituted for
the fine old Scots melodies” (<i>The</i> [London] <i>Graphic</i>, CVIII, 1923, 340). The music
has not survived, but the discriminating review in <i>The Universal Magazine</i>
praised Linley’s skill in preserving the original airs while providing accompaniments
for an expanded orchestra (LXIX, 1781, 237). The dialogue, however handled,
was certain to produce disagreement, but Tickell was more faithful to the
original than previous adapters had been. On this point James Boaden wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The simple beauties of the poem were ... felt on this occasion, and the lovers
of rustic nature were obliged to Mr. Tickell for the restoration of its original
language—the <i>pronunciation</i>, and still more the <i>cadence</i>, suffered as might be
expected from diffidence and badness of ear (<i>Memoirs of Mrs. Siddons</i>, 1827,
I, 252).</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><i>The Carnival of Venice</i> opened on 13 December 1781 and played twenty-three
times during the season but was never revived. It was written to suit what Tickell
himself, in a letter to an aspiring playwright, called “the present taste for complicated
plot and perplexed incidents” (unpublished letter to A. Becket, August 1781,
in the Widener Collection, Harvard College Library); for the plot, see the review
in <i>The Universal Magazine</i>, LXIX, 1781, 328. The music was provided by Linley,
and the elaborate sets and costumes by De Loutherbourg. In particular the songs
were admired: Tom Moore and Samuel Rogers remembered and quoted them in the
next century (Moore, <i>Sheridan</i>, 2nd ed., 1825, II, 227; Rogers, <i>Table-Talk</i>, p. 72).
Mary Young, in her <i>Memoirs of Mrs. Crouch</i>, 1806, said that “Many of the songs
in this piece so perfectly resemble, in poetic beauty, those which adorn the Duenna
[by Sheridan], that they declare themselves to be the offspring of the same Muse”
(I, 127). Sheridan’s biographers have variously ascribed the songs, in part or entirely,
to him and Mrs. Sheridan, but on what grounds save their excellence does not
appear (Sichel, <i>Sheridan</i>, I, 443, and II, 459; Rae, article on Tickell in the <i>DNB</i>).</p>

<p>Assigned to Tickell by a MS. note on the title-page of a copy of the Fourth Edition
in the New York Public Library. It is characteristically Tickell’s in substance
and style. Intended as an attack on a proposed reduction of the tea-duty, it enlarges
into a satire on Pitt’s administration, especially the ascendancy of the East India
Company interest therein. While the Company continues its corrupt sway, Pitt directs
the energies of Parliament to “Edicts against the Waste of Wafers in Public Offices,
and Registrations of the Nett Consumption of Quills; together with Sworn Meters
of Sand, and a Comptroller-General of Blotting-Paper.”</p>

<p>Contributions to <i>The Rolliad</i>.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>The work known as <i>The Rolliad</i> is only for the sake of convenience so styled. The
name serves as a collective title for a group of many works, differently titled and
separately published, ranging from squibs a quatrain long to extended mock-heroic
poems. These collaborative Whig satires began to appear in Henry Bate’s <i>Morning
Herald</i> late in 1784; and the inclusive editions, issued from 1795 on under the title
of <i>The Rolliad</i>, contain <i>Criticisms on The Rolliad</i>, <i>Political Eclogues</i>, <i>Probationary
Odes for the Laureateship</i>, and <i>Political Miscellanies</i>. Many ancillary pieces by the
same group of authors appeared in newspapers and fugitive miscellanies but were
never reprinted.</p>

<p>A good deal has been written in appreciation of the literary and political satire of
the <i>Rolliad</i> pieces, but no thorough study of their history and bibliography has been
attempted. So complex is their bibliography that it is impossible to give a satisfactory
account of any single author’s share. The principal information on authorship will
be found in several contributions to <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 1st ser., II, 1850, and III,
1851, from copies of <i>The Rolliad</i> annotated by the authors or by those who knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
them, as follows: French Laurence’s notes, II, 373, and III, 129-131; George Ellis’
notes, II, 114-115; Alexander Chalmers’ notes, II, 242; Sir James Mackintosh’s
notes, III, 131. To these should be added Sheridan’s notes in a copy used by Walter
Sichel; see his <i>Sheridan</i>, II, 87ff. There is much other scattered information, of
which full use has not yet been made, in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century
memoirs and journals.</p>

<p>According to French Laurence, who acted as editor, “the piece first published, and
the origin of all that followed,” was the “Short Account of the Family of the Rollos,
now Rolles,” written principally by Tickell and purporting to be a genealogy of the
family of John Rolle, M.P. for Devon, the unlucky hero of the projected mock epic.
Tickell designed the absurd family tree that served as frontispiece for <i>Criticisms on
The Rolliad</i> (information from Sheridan, in Lord Broughton [John Cam Hobhouse],
<i>Recollections of a Long Life</i>, ed. Lady Dorchester, 1909-11, I, 202). He
had also a leading hand in the next project of the group, the <i>Probationary Odes</i>,
for which he provided the editorial preliminaries, the first of the trial odes, supposed
to be by Sir Cecil Wray, and the ninth, supposed to be by Nathaniel Wraxall
and one of the best in the series. (According to Mackintosh, the ninth ode was
“sketched by Canning, the Eton boy, finished by Tickell.”) The most successful of
the <i>Political Eclogues</i>, a satire on Lord Lansdowne called <i>Jekyll</i>, was the collaborative
work of Tickell and Lord John Townshend; it first appeared as a quarto poem
published by J. Debrett, 1788. For the smaller contributions of Tickell, which are
numerous, the lists in <i>Notes and Queries</i> may be consulted.</p>

131). It is assigned to a different author in Halkett and Laing (new ed., 1926-34,
VI, 252), where a copy is reported that contains a MS. dedication signed “Lieut. J.
Mackenzie.” Tickell’s statement of authorship, the lack of any information about
J. Mackenzie, and various circumstances (too involved to detail here) relating to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Whig propagandist activity at this time, all suggest that Lieut. J. Mackenzie is a
fictitious person. As the Foxites’ chief pamphleteer Tickell did his duty, but as a
member of Brooks’s he did not care to associate his name with a sober commercial
tract.</p>

<p>Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Editions, Debrett, 1787. Dublin:
White, Byrne, Moore, and Jones, 1787.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>This tract is here first assigned to Tickell. His letter to Parr of 20 February
[1787], mentioned in the preceding entry, begins:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>From some enquiries in your letter to Mrs. Sheridan, I believe you thought
it was right to answer <i>the Political Review</i>. I mean the pamphlet that traduced
the Prince of Wales and every one else except Hastings. I now send you
the answer I gave it, because, as you thought it right it should be answered,
you will excuse faults in a paper written in a hurry (Parr, <i>Works</i>, VIII, 131).</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The pamphlet to which Tickell refers is <i>A Short Review of the Political State of
Great-Britain at the Commencement of the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and
Eighty-Seven</i>, Debrett, 1787, a collection of political portraits and cursory observations
as thin in substance as they are florid in style. Its authorship was acknowledged
in the <i>Posthumous Memoirs</i>, 1836, of Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, who told there of its
immense success upon publication: it ran through six editions in the last ten days of
January, sold 17,000 copies, and elicited a half-dozen replies within a month (<i>Historical
and Posthumous Memoirs</i>, 1884, IV, 372-375). <i>The People’s Answer</i> was
written from Tickell’s precise political position at this time and displays his characteristic
style.</p>

<p>Beginning in his usual brisk and pointed manner, Tickell suggests that the celebrity
of the <i>Short Review</i> is due largely to such a total want of polite wit among the
supporters of Administration “that even a Charade from one of the <i>King’s Friends</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
would excite ... admiration.” The author has provided “the dull desponding train
of an unlettered Court” with</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">a sort of handy manual for the Levee ..., lightly touching on the topicks
most in vogue, and sketching out handy sentences for the Lords of the Bedchamber
to retail, or the Maids of Honour to scribble on their fans.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Here is the hand of the author of <i>The Wreath of Fashion</i>. In his treatment of Pitt’s
commercial treaty, his gift of mimicry is also apparent. Tickell the elegant amateur
cannot resist parodying the style of writers on commercial subjects:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Every leaf of these motley compositions displays an epitome of all the tricks
of invitation, that are practised by the trades they discuss; some of them intoxicating
the eye, like Vintners’ windows, with BRANDY! RUM! and
BRITISH SPIRIT! in capitals—while others denote their beaten track, and
towns of baiting; like the lettered pannels of a stage coach, in characters of a
most extensive and convincing size; as,</p>

<table summary=" ">
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>HULL,</li>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Perhaps the most amusing thing about this passage is that Tickell is ridiculing,
among others, himself, for these are the very devices of the honest Woollen Draper’s
<i>Letter</i>. The defence of the Prince of Wales’ conduct and friends, which occupies the
later pages of <i>The People’s Answer</i>, is in a more serious tone.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
